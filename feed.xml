        <title>My love-hate relationship with JavaScript</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Please follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/deepu105&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for updates and let me know what can be improved in the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are three types of programmers, the ones who love JavaScript, the ones who hate JavaScript and the ones who do both. JavaScript is the second language(First was C/C++) I learned when I was trying to run my Wordpress blog. It was even before I started my career. When I started my engineering career I started as a Java Web app developer, which meant I had the chance to work on JavaScript as well for the front-end part. I was pretty good at JS/HTML/CSS and soon I was doing a lot of front-end focused Java Web apps. I also learned JQuery and fell in love with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During the initial years of my career, JavaScript was undoubtedly the language I loved the most as I found it insanely flexible and easy, especially when I wanted to hack something together fast, even though I was doing an equal amount of coding in Java as well. My former immature self even used to believe that JavaScript was the best programming language in the world and I used to vehemently debate anyone who thought JavaScript wasn’t good, I mean I did have some good reasons to think so. Fast forward to now and I think I know better and in my attempts at being more pragmatic, I started looking at languages and frameworks more objectively and without bias. Now I wouldn’t say JavaScript is the best language out there, but its a very important one, I know its flaws and there are things I dislike in the JS ecosystem which now I’m mature enough to admit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don’t get me wrong, I still love JavaScript(TypeScript even more) and I have seen the rise and fall of frameworks from JQuery to current MVVM frameworks and worked with most of them. JavaScript is one of the most loved and most hated language at the same time. You may notice that many of the things I like about JavaScript are the same I dislike as well and that’s why the title. So after more than 10 years of working with JavaScript and its huge ecosystem here is what I think about the language. Please note that a lot of them are personal preference based opinions and hence might sound a bit biased.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-like-about-javascript&quot;&gt;What I like about JavaScript&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let us talk about things that I love in JavaScript&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beginner-friendly-but-also-powerful&quot;&gt;Beginner friendly but also powerful&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is one of the easiest languages for beginners. Regardless of its quirks, it’s easy to get started. You don’t even need to install or set up anything. If you have a web browser on your computer that is all you need to write JavaScript. There is also an infinite amount of help available on the internet. The basic syntax is quite easy and the basic concepts are easy to follow as well. This doesn’t mean it is a simple language, we will talk about that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is also a really powerful language as you can get almost anything done with JavaScript like building a web page, a server app, a mobile app, a robot and so on (doesn’t mean you should 😜). There is no other language that I have seen which is as versatile as JavaScript. But remember learning JavaScript is easy but becoming a good JavaScript developer is quite hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;dynamic--extremely-flexible&quot;&gt;Dynamic &amp;amp; Extremely flexible&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript is the most dynamic language that I have used, there are things that you can do it JavaScript which is not even thinkable in many other languages. You can get away with a lot in JavaScript as its a very forgiving language. Changing the type of variables at runtime? no problem, add variables and methods to a class you have no control over? no problem, write code that generates code? no problem. The list just goes on. This kind of dynamic behavior is really useful for some use-cases, especially scripting or a templating engine for example.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it’s not without its costs. Flexibility is the biggest strength and biggest weakness of JavaScript, it is extremely handy when it comes to scripting and stuff but means makes maintenance harder in larger codebases, we will see about that in the dislike section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I spend a good amount of time in my career creating prototypes and PoCs and the dynamic nature and flexibility of JavaScript made that productive and easy, but I would never recommend those for real applications that need to be maintained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, you can do the below in JavaScript to build dynamic functions&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;++&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;functions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`myAwesomeFunc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;fnName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`console.log('Hello world from ' + fnName + ' fn created by index &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;');`&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Object&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;values&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;functions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// prints&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Hello world from anonymous fn created by index 0&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// ...&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Hello world from anonymous fn created by index 9&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;multiparadigm&quot;&gt;Multiparadigm&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript started as an imperative scripting language and later added features to make OOP possible and due to a lot of features it has you can &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/easy-functional-programming-techniques-in-typescript-for-everyone-1bl2&quot;&gt;use it as a functional programming language&lt;/a&gt; as well. I like this in a language as you can use the best of all paradigms to get your work done efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functions-as-first-class-citizens&quot;&gt;Functions as first-class citizens&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functions in JavaScript are first-class citizens and they don’t differ from any other type of objects in JavaScript. You can pass them around, create them at runtime, change them, store them and so on. You can even add attributes to a function.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`Hello world! &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Yo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// prints 'Hello world! Yo'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;useful-syntax-sugarspersonal-preference&quot;&gt;Useful syntax sugars(personal preference)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript provides a lot of useful syntax sugars like async/await, spread/rest operators, destructuring, ternary operator and so on and I really like them as they make code less verbose for trained eyes. Of course, if you are very new to JS they might seem a bit confusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;metaprogramming&quot;&gt;Metaprogramming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript has great support for Metaprogramming. It provides the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Proxy&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Reflect&lt;/code&gt; objects that allow you to intercept and define custom behavior to existing language operators. Definitely an advanced feature which has its own use-cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;less-verbose-and-clean-syntaxpersonal-preference&quot;&gt;Less verbose and clean syntax(personal preference)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I might be a bit biased here as JavaScript and Java are the languages I have worked with most and so when it comes to syntax I might be unconsciously finding them nicer. It definitely is possible to write unreadable code in JavaScript but at the same time you can write beautiful expressive code as well and I find the JS syntax more readable than many other languages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;can-run-anywhere&quot;&gt;Can run anywhere&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technically JavaScript can run anywhere. It is undoubtedly the biggest programming platform in the world, especially due to the internet, as JavaScript is the language of the web. You can run JS in a browser, mobile devices, server-side, Desktop apps, OS, IoT, robots, virtual reality, smartwatches, from other languages like Java and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@anildash/what-if-javascript-wins-84898e5341a&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; is an interesting article from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/anildash&quot;&gt;Anil Dash&lt;/a&gt; about this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;biggest-community&quot;&gt;Biggest community&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript has the biggest community out there, its the most popular programming language after all. The NPM repository has more packages than most other &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.modulecounts.com/&quot;&gt;languages combined&lt;/a&gt; and you will find help easily for anything related to JS on the web and there is a huge ecosystem around JavaScript making it really easy to work with. Whatever need you have, you can be sure there will be a JavaScript library or tool for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/sgemskcd1bha7iwqqooh.png&quot; alt=&quot;Js module counts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;as-long-as-web-browsers-and-internet-is-around-javascript-will-be-around&quot;&gt;As long as web browsers and internet is around JavaScript will be around&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whenever people say Java and JavaScript are like dinosaurs(old, outdated and bulky) I try to correct them. IMO, JS and Java are like cockroaches they can survive anything and I’m pretty sure JavaScript will be around for the foreseeable future unless there is a huge revolution in the internet industry making way to something else. So your skills in JS is gonna be pretty relevant and hence is an important skill to have.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nodejs&quot;&gt;NodeJS&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the reasons the JavaScript community grew is also because of NodeJS, It paved the way for JS to be considered outside of the web browser and boy did that explode. I like NodeJS as it lets anyone build and publish reusable packages to the community without having to spend too much effort. Of course, there are issues like fragmentation and bloat to address but NodeJS still is an important tool in a programmer’s arsenal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;typescript&quot;&gt;Typescript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You might argue TypeScript is its own language, but technically its a syntax superset of JavaScript and hence I would rather place it here. TypeScript addresses a lot of common issues in JavaScript like support for static typing, scalability and so on. So this is definitely something I would put in the like column. I wish every JavaScript runtime had native support for TypeScript(like &lt;a href=&quot;https://deno.land/&quot;&gt;Deno&lt;/a&gt; for example) or that JS evolves into TypeScript(that would be super cool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-dont-like-about-javascript&quot;&gt;What I don’t like about JavaScript&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let’s talk about things that I don’t like in JavaScript language and ecosystem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;fragmentation-browser-implementations-version-compatibility&quot;&gt;Fragmentation (Browser implementations, version compatibility)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For me the biggest issue for JavaScript is fragmentation. The JS model is that the end-user can choose the implementation, which means the programmer has very little control over what implementation her/his code will run against. There are two major parts at play here when it comes to implementation;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vendor&lt;/strong&gt;: There are so many different JS engines with slightly different implementations making the life of programmers hell. For example, there is the V8 engine used by Chrome, NodeJs, Opera and so on and SpiderMonkey from Mozilla, JavaScriptCore from apple and many more.
The problem is the ECMAScript standard for JS doesn’t have any reference implementation and vendors slightly change implementation details to fit their needs making the same code behave differently in different engines. remember Internet explorer? A major share of the front-end code written in the last two decades is just for browser compatibility, as the huge portion of the JQuery codebase which was to make it work in Internet explorer. While I’m glad that the IE browser is finally EOL, there are still subtle bugs arising from these differing implementations every now and then for someone building JS apps.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Version&lt;/strong&gt;: Another reason for fragmentation is the ECMAScript version, again vendors go ahead and implement versions as and when they like making it impossible for developers to rely on any particular version as they wouldn’t know if end-user has a browser that supports this version. This leads way to an unwanted middleman like Babel transpiling your code to the common denominator, mostly to ES5 adding complexity and overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the biggest issues even present today because of these factors is the JS module system, everyone uses a module system(requireJS, commonJS or ES modules) but still, there is no consensus on what should be the standard implementation and its quite frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is probably why JS is the only language with such dedicated websites like &lt;a href=&quot;https://caniuse.com/#search=modules&quot;&gt;caniuse.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wish there was a single-engine managed by the community and used by all the browsers and runtimes thus making fragmentation less of an issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beauracracy&quot;&gt;Beauracracy&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript being a huge community comes with its own Beauracracy and process layer similar to Java, there are different governing bodies like ECMA International, ISO, JS Foundation, W3C and so on which has stakes in the future of JavaScript, then there are different browser vendors like Google, Mozilla, and Apple with their own agenda, all this makes language evolution slow, messy and painful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;language-quirks&quot;&gt;Language quirks&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes I wonder if JavaScript was designed by someone during an acid(LSD) + Ecstasy trip as there are quirks in the language that is mind-numbing. I don’t think you will find so many quirks in any other languages and hence it gives criticizers of JavaScript a field day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a whole repo dedicated to documenting this https://github.com/denysdovhan/wtfjs&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is a sample, don’t even try to understand what happens here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-javascript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[])[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[])[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+!+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;([&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[][[]])[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+!+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]]]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[])[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;!+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// prints 'fail'&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;npm-hell&quot;&gt;Npm hell&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NodeJS was like a blessing to JavaScript community and it brought NPM along which really has exploded and now it is kind of annoyance that JavaScript developers have learned to live with. Have you ever tried to find the number of files in a &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node_modules&lt;/code&gt; folder?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;NPM is a good package manager and has some pretty great features like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;npm link&lt;/code&gt; for example but its nested dependency structure along with fluid versioning makes it a recipe for disaster and countless hours of painful debugging sessions. Also, there is the issue of a monolithic registry holding so many packages used by so many applications. Remember &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.npmjs.org/post/141577284765/kik-left-pad-and-npm&quot;&gt;leftpad&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;error-prone-a-side-effect-of-flexibility&quot;&gt;Error prone (a side effect of flexibility)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With JavaScript, it is too easy to shoot in the foot. Well, JavaScript will give you 100 different types of loaded guns, it will hold your hand while you point your gun and will pull the trigger if you hesitate and once you have shot at your foot, it will cut off your leg and make you eat it. I didn’t want to go all cannibalistic here but that’s how it is with JavaScript. A lot of it has to do with the fact that JavaScript was never designed for the scale that it has today. It was a simple dynamic scripting language. Since JavaScript is too dynamic and flexible it lets you do all sorts of stuff that many other languages will not allow and combine that with the huge list of quirks, bugs are just waiting to happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the situation is much better with newer versions and with many tools like ESList, VSCode, TypeScript and so on that help you a lot to avoid common mistakes, but even with all that it really takes experience and hard work to write large JavaScript programs without subtle bugs. In my career, most of the debugging sessions that I have done would be in JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;yet-another-framework-syndrome&quot;&gt;Yet another framework syndrome&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also the phenomena that is unique to JavaScript, its called &lt;strong&gt;Yet another framework syndrome&lt;/strong&gt;, new frameworks and libraries are invented on a daily basis, almost, and the churn is so great that if you take a break of one year from JS world and comeback you won’t be able to recognize anything and will find yourself learning some new framework. This means teams maintaining JavaScript applications are constantly spending time migrating to newer frameworks from obsolete ones and so on. I had to spend a lot of time migrating from JQuery to AngularJS, AngularJS to Angular, Angular to React and so on in my career. The churn rate in Java, for example, is extremely low compared to this. The JS community also seems to suffer from &lt;strong&gt;not invented here&lt;/strong&gt; syndrome much more than other language communities, you will find at least a dozen options for everything here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;complexity&quot;&gt;Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I said earlier, JavaScript is very beginner-friendly and easy to learn but it is not a simple language at its current form. It has evolved a lot and along with all the simplicity on its cover has quite a lot of complex features underneath and it keeps on growing, and due to its legacy and dynamic nature it has too many ways to do the same thing, which I dislike in any language, and has a complex ecosystem that one must learn to use JavaScript at scale. You would have to learn stuff like Webpack, NodeJS, NPM, Babel, ESLint and so on to be productive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also very easy to write complex unreadable code in JavaScript using callbacks and stuff, generally referred to as callback hell! Add to this the dynamic nature, legacy quirks and the complexity keeps on increasing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;scalability&quot;&gt;Scalability&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JavaScript by itself is not scalable at all, you will be productive when the codebase is small but as it grows the issues starts to appear, due to the lack of a type system, large codebases become a nightmare to maintain unless you are using something like TypeScript on top. Even with that large JavaScript codebases are much more difficult to traverse and maintain compared to other languages, I have experience of this from &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster&quot;&gt;JHipster&lt;/a&gt; for example. Soon you will find yourself adding build tools, linters, transpilers and so on to ease maintenance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nitpicks&quot;&gt;Nitpicks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, when it comes to JavaScript you either love it, hate it or both, there are no real nitpicks at least for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you search on the internet for opinions on JavaScript, you will find tons and tons of content, some praising it, some bashing it, and some objective. A lot can be said about JavaScript and its community. For most its a love-hate relationship, some are brave enough to admit that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely hate JavaScript then either you haven’t worked with it a lot or you are holding some prejudice against it. Try it, its a fun language(at least it will keep you awake a lot 😜), it has its purpose and like it or not its the language of the modern web, and it does a pretty good job there. If you think you can be more productive on the web using any other language, then maybe you should try building a large website using that language, then learn JS and try the same. IMO JS is not going anywhere and if anything it is only getting more and more adoption, so it would be foolish not to know the most popular language. Every programmer should learn JavaScript, you never know when it would be handy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you absolutely love JavaScript and use JavaScript to everything, then maybe you should also learn few other languages like Java, Go or Rust and you would see why JavaScript is not ideal for many use-cases(It can, of course, do it, any Turing complete language can, that doesn’t mean you should do it)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key is not knowing how to use JavaScript, it is knowing when to use JavaScript and when not.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Easy functional programming techniques in Rust for everyone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of hype around functional programming(FP) and a lot of cool kids are doing it but it is not a silver bullet. Like other programming paradigms/styles, functional programming also has its pros and cons and one may prefer one paradigm over the other. If you are a Rust developer and wants to venture into functional programming, do not worry, you don’t have to learn functional programming oriented languages like Haskell or Clojure(or even Scala or JavaScript though they are not pure functional programming languages) since Rust has you covered and this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for functional programming in Java, Golang or TypeScript check other posts in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not gonna dive into all functional programming concepts in detail, instead, I’m gonna focus on things that you can do in Rust which are in line with functional programming concepts. I’m also not gonna discuss the pros and cons of functional programming in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that some introductions in this post are repeated from my other posts in the series for your ease of reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-functional-programming&quot;&gt;What is functional programming?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence in functional programming, there are two very important rules&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Data mutations&lt;/strong&gt;: It means a data object should not be changed after it is created.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No implicit state&lt;/strong&gt;: Hidden/Implicit state should be avoided. In functional programming state is not eliminated, instead, its made visible and explicit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No side effects&lt;/strong&gt;: A function or operation should not change any state outside of its functional scope. I.e, A function should only return a value to the invoker and should not affect any external state. This means programs are easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure functions only&lt;/strong&gt;: Functional code is idempotent. A function should return values only based on the arguments passed and should not affect(side-effect) or depend on the global state. Such functions always produce the same result for the same arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these there are functional programming concepts below that can be applied in Rust, we will touch upon these further down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function&quot;&gt;Higher-order-functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;Closures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying&quot;&gt;Currying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;Recursion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy&quot;&gt;Lazy evaluations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency&quot;&gt;Referential transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using functional programming doesn’t mean its all or nothing, you can always use functional programming concepts to complement Object-oriented or imperative concepts in Rust. The benefits of functional programming can be utilized whenever possible regardless of the paradigm or language you use. And that is exactly what we are going to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functional-programming-in-rust&quot;&gt;Functional programming in Rust&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is primarily geared towards procedural/imperative style of programming but it also lets you do a little bit of functional and object-oriented style of programming as well. And that is my favorite kind of mix. So let us see how we can apply some of the functional programming concepts above in Rust using the language features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-class-and-higher-order-functions&quot;&gt;First-class and higher-order functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First-class functions(function as a first-class citizen) means you can assign functions to variables, pass a function as an argument to another function or return a function from another. Functions in Rust are a bit more complex than other languages, it’s not as straightforward as in Go or JavaScript. There are different kinds of functions and two different ways of writing them. The first one is a function that cannot memoize its outer context and the second one is closures which can memoize its outer context. Hence concepts like currying and higher-order-functions are possible in Rust but may not be as easy to wrap your head around as in other languages. Also, functions that accept a closure can also accept a pointer to a function depending on the context. In many places, Rust functions and closures can be interchangeable. It would have been nicer if functions were simple and we could do all the below without having to rely on closures. But Rust chose these compromises for better memory safety and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function can be considered as a higher-order-function only if it takes one or more functions as parameters or if it returns another function as a result.
In Rust, this is quite easy to do with closures, it might look a bit verbose but if you are familiar with Rust then you should be fine.&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// we are passing the array and a closure as arguments to map_for_each method.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map_for_each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{:?}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// [6, 5, 6, 5]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// The higher-order-function takes an array and a closure as arguments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map_for_each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.iter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// We are executing the closure passed&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also more complex versions that you can write with generics like below for an example&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// we are passing the array and a closure as arguments to map_for_each method.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;map_for_each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{:?}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// [4, 25, 64, 100]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// The higher-order-function takes an array and a closure as arguments, but uses generic types&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map_for_each&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;A&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;B&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.iter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// We are executing the closure passed&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;fun&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;new_array&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then we could also simply do it this way using built-in functional methods like map, fold(reduce) and so on which is much less verbose. Rust provides a lot of useful functional style methods for working on collections like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;fold&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;for_each&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Orange&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Banana&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Grape&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// we are passing a closure as arguments to the built-in map method.&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Vec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.iter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;())&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.collect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{:?}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// [6, 5, 6, 5]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closures in Rust can memorize and mutate its outer context but due to the concept of ownership in Rust, you cannot have multiple closures mutating the same variables in the outer context. Currying is also possible in Rust but again due to ownership and lifetime concepts, it might feel a bit more verbose.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// this is a higher-order-function that returns a closure&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;impl&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// we are currying the add method to create more variations&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 15&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 25&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 35&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pure-functions&quot;&gt;Pure functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw already a pure function should return values only based on the arguments passed and should not affect or depend on the global state. It is possible to do this in Rust easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take the below, this is a pure function. It will always return the same output for the given input and its behavior is highly predictable. We can safely cache the method if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But since Rust variables are immutable by default, unless specified a function cannot mutate any variables passed to it and cannot capture any variable in its context. So if we try to affect external state like below the compiler will complain “can’t capture dynamic environment in a fn item”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;holder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;format!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;${a}+${b}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rust, in order to capture external state, we would have to use closures, so we can rewrite the above as&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;holder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;HashMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;|&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;holder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.insert&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;format!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;${a}+${b}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But the compilation will still fail with the message “cannot borrow &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/code&gt; as mutable, as it is not declared as mutable”. So in order to do external state mutation, we would have to explicitly specify the function as mutable like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;let mut sum = ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Rust will help you keep your functions pure and simple by default. Of course, that doesn’t mean you can avoid side effects that don’t involve variable mutations, for those you have to take care of it yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recursion&quot;&gt;Recursion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming favors recursion over looping. Let us see an example for calculating the factorial of a number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional iterative approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;while&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be done using recursion as below which is favored in functional programming – But recursion is not the solution always, for some cases a simple loop is more readable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of the recursive approach is that it will be slower compared to an iterative approach most of the times(The advantage we are aiming for is code simplicity and readability) and might result in stack overflow errors since every function call needs to be saved as a frame to the stack. To avoid this tail recursion is preferred, especially when the recursion is done too many times. In tail recursion, the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function and hence the functions stack frame need not be saved by the compiler. Most compilers can optimize the tail recursion code the same way iterative code is optimized hence avoiding the performance penalty. But unfortunately, Rust does not support this yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider using recursion when writing Rust code for readability and immutability, but if performance is critical or if the number of iterations will be huge use the standard iterative approach.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lazy-evaluation&quot;&gt;Lazy evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazy evaluation or non-strict evaluation is the process of delaying the evaluation of an expression until it is needed. In general, Rust does strict/eager evaluation. We can utilize higher-order-functions, closures, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization&quot;&gt;memoization&lt;/a&gt; techniques to do lazy evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this example where Rust eagerly evaluates everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will produce the below output and we can see that both functions are executed always&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

16
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use higher-order-functions to rewrite this into a lazily evaluated version&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;executing add&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// this is printed since the functions are evaluated first&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;FnType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add_or_multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 8&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add_or_multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 16&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outputs the below and we can see that only required functions were executed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

16
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can also use memoization/caching techniques to avoid unwanted evaluations in pure and referentially transparent functions like below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add_or_multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;on_add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;on_multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;usize&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;on_add&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;on_multiply&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add_or_multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 8&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add_or_multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outputs the below and we can see that functions were executed only once for the same values.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;executing add

16
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These may not look that elegant especially to seasoned Rust programmers. Fortunately, most of the functional APIs, like the iterators, provided by Rust do lazy evaluations and there are libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/reem/rust-lazy&quot;&gt;rust-lazy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.rs/thunk/0.3.0/thunk/&quot;&gt;Thunk&lt;/a&gt; which can be used to make functions lazy. Also, Rust provides some advanced types with which lazy evaluations can be implemented.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Doing Lazy evaluations in Rust might not be worth the code complexity some of the times, but if the functions in question are heavy in terms of processing then it is absolutely worth it to lazy evaluate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-system&quot;&gt;Type system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is a strong statically typed language and also has great type inference. There are also advanced concepts like type aliasing and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;referential-transparency&quot;&gt;Referential transparency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Functional programs do not have assignment statements, that is, the value of a variable in a functional program never changes once defined. This eliminates any chances of side effects because any variable can be replaced with its actual value at any point of execution. So, functional programs are referentially transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust has great ways to ensure referential transparency, variables in Rust are immutable by default and even reference passing is immutable by default. So you would have to explicitly mark variables or references as mutable to do so. So in Rust, it is actually quite easy to avoid mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the below will produce an error&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Orange&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Banana&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Grape&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;John&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Raju&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Sabi&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Vicky&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And so does all of the below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;vec!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Orange&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Banana&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Grape&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Strawberry&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// This will fail as the reference is immutable&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mutating_fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// this will fail unless the argument is marked mutable reference or value passed is marked mutable reference&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mutating_fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Strawberry&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// this will fail if the reference is not passed as mutable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to compile these, we would have to riddle it with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/code&gt; keywords&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;vec!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Banana&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Grape&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Strawberry&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// This will work as the reference is mutable&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mutating_fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;sc&quot;&gt;'!'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// this will work as the argument is marked as a mutable reference&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;mutating_fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Strawberry&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// this will work as the reference is passed as mutable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are even more advanced concepts in Rust when it comes to data mutation and all that makes it easier to write immutable code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-structures&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_data_structure&quot;&gt;Data structures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using functional programming techniques it is encouraged to use data types such as Stacks, Maps, and Queues as they also have functional implementations. Hence Hashmaps are better than arrays or hash sets as data stores in functional programming. Rust provides such data types and is hence conforms to the functional specifications regarding data structures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just an introduction for those who are trying to apply some functional programming techniques in Rust. There are a lot more that can be done in Rust. As I said earlier functional programming is not a silver bullet but it offers a lot of useful techniques for more understandable, maintainable and testable code. It can co-exist perfectly well with imperative and object-oriented programming styles. In fact, we all should be using the best of everything to solve the problem at hand instead of getting too obsessed about a single methodology.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My first impressions of Rust</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Please follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/deepu105&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I started learning Rust a while ago and since my post about what &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/my-reflections-on-golang-38jk&quot;&gt;I thought of Go&lt;/a&gt; was popular, I decided to write about what my first impressions of Rust were as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But unlike Go, I actually didn’t build any real-world application in Rust, so my opinions here are purely personal and some might not be accurate as I might have misunderstood something. So do give me the consideration of a Rust newbie. If you find something I said here is inaccurate please do let me know. Also, my impressions might actually change once I start using the language more. If it does, I’ll make sure to update the post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I have said in some of my other posts, I consider myself to be more pragmatic than my younger self now. Some of the opinions are also from that pragmatic perspective(or at least I think so). 
I have weighed practicality, readability, and simplicity over fancy features, syntax sugars, and complexity. Also, some things which I didn’t like but found not such a big deal are put under nitpicks rather than the dislike section as I thought it was fairer that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that sets Rust apart from languages like Go is that Rust is not garbage collected, and I understand that many of the language features/choices where designed with that in mind.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is primarily geared towards procedural/imperative style of programming but it also lets you do a little bit of functional and object-oriented style of programming as well. And that is my favorite kind of mix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, without any further ado, let’s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-like-about-rust&quot;&gt;What I like about Rust&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that I really liked, in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;no-garbage-collection&quot;&gt;No Garbage collection&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the first things you would notice in Rust, especially if you are coming from garbage collected languages like Java or Golang is the lack of garbage collection. Yes, there is no GC in Rust, then how does it ensure my program runs efficiently in the given memory and how does it prevent out of memory errors?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust has something called &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch04-01-what-is-ownership.html&quot;&gt;ownership&lt;/a&gt;, so basically any value in Rust must have a variable as its owner(and only one owner at a time) when the owner goes out of scope the value will be dropped freeing the memory regardless of it being in stack or heap memory. For example, in the below example the value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is dropped as soon as the method execution completes and the value of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/code&gt; is dropped right after the block execution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;value&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// owner is foo and is valid within this method&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;bar value&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// owner is bar and is valid within this block scope&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;value of bar is {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// bar is valid here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;value of foo is {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// foo is valid here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;value of bar is {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// bar is not valid here as its out of scope&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So by scoping variables carefully, we can make sure the memory usage is optimized and that is also why Rust lets you use block scopes almost everywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, the Rust compiler helps you in dealing with duplicate pointer references and so on. The below is invalid in Rust since &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; is now using heap memory rather than stack and assigning a reference to a variable is considered a move. If deep copying(expensive) is required it has to be performed using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;clone&lt;/code&gt; function which performs a copy instead of move.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// owner is foo and is valid within this method&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// owner is bar and is valid within this block scope, foo in invalidated now&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;value of bar is {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// bar is valid here&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;value of foo is {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// foo is invalid here as it has moved&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ownership concept can be a bit weird to get used to, especially since passing a variable to a method will also move it(if its not a literal or reference), but given that it saves us from GC I think its worth it and the compiler takes care of helping us when we make mistakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;immutable-by-default&quot;&gt;Immutable by default&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables are immutable by default. If you want to mutate a variable you have to specifically mark it using the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// immutable&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;mut&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// mutable &lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Variables are by default passed by value, in order to pass a reference we would have to use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; symbol. Quite similar to Golang.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hello_ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// pass by reference. Keeps ownership&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// prints: Hello world&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hello_val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;world&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// pass by value and hence transfer ownership&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// prints: Hello world&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hello_val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;hello_ref&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Hello {}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;msg&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you pass a reference it is still immutable so we would have to explicitly mark that mutable as well as below. This makes accidental mutations very difficult. The compiler also ensures that we can only have one mutable reference in a scope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// prints: Hello world!&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// prints: Hello world!&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;pattern-matching&quot;&gt;Pattern matching&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust has first-class support for pattern matching and this can be used for control flow, error handling, variable assignment and so on. pattern matching can also be used in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;if&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statements, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;for&lt;/code&gt; loops and function parameters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;200&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;u32&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.parse&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;panic!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Cannot parse!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;200&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;two hundred&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(),&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;generics&quot;&gt;Generics&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing I love in Java and TypeScript is the generics. It makes static typing more practical and DRY. Strongly typed languages(Looking at you Golang) without generics are annoying to work with. Fortunately, Rust has great support for generics. It can be used in types, functions, structs, and enums. The icing on the cake is that Rust converts the Generic code using specific code during compile time thus there is no performance penalty in using them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;static-types-and-advanced-type-declarations&quot;&gt;Static types and advanced type declarations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust is a strictly typed language with a static type system. It also has great type inference which means we don’t have to define types manually for everything. Rust also allows for complex type definitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Kilometers&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;i32&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Thunk&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Box&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dyn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;Send&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;'static&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;type&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;std&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;io&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;nice-and-simple-error-handling&quot;&gt;Nice and simple error handling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Error handling in Rust is quite nice, there are recoverable and unrecoverable errors. For recoverable errors, you can handle them using pattern matching on the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Result&lt;/code&gt; enum or using the simple expect syntax. There is even a shorthand operator to propagate errors from a function. Take that Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;hello.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;.expect&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Failed to open hello.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// or&lt;/span&gt;
    
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;f&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;match&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nn&quot;&gt;File&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;open&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;hello.txt&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Ok&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;file&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;Err&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;panic!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Problem opening the file: {:?}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;error&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;},&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;tuples&quot;&gt;Tuples&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust has built-in support for tuples, and this is highly helpful when you have to return multiple values from a function or when you want to unwrap a value and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;block-expressions&quot;&gt;Block expressions&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rust, you can have block expressions with their own scope almost anywhere. It also lets you assign a variable value from block expressions, if statement, loops and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Assigning foo&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;bar&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;6&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;};&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;beautiful-compiler-output&quot;&gt;Beautiful compiler output&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust simply has the best error output during compilation that I have seen. It can’t get better than this I think. It is so helpful.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/3a6kh5lvp8nqx34xh00c.png&quot; alt=&quot;Alt Text&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;built-in-tooling&quot;&gt;Built-in tooling&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like many modern programming languages, Rust also provides a lot of build-in standard tooling and honestly, I think this is one of the best that I have come across. Rust has &lt;a href=&quot;https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-03-hello-cargo.html&quot;&gt;Cargo&lt;/a&gt; which is the built-in package manager and build system. It is an excellent tool. It takes care of all common project needs like compiling, building, testing and so on. It can even create new projects with a skeleton and manage packages globally and locally for the project. That means you don’t have to worry about setting up any tooling to get started in Rust. I love this, it saves so much time and effort. Every programming language should have this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust also provides built-in utilities and asserts to write tests which then can be executed using Cargo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Rust, related functionality is grouped into modules, modules are grouped together into something called crates and crates are grouped into packages. We can refer to items defined in one module from another module. Packages are managed by cargo. You can specify external packages in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Cargo.toml&lt;/code&gt; file. Reusable public packages can be published to the &lt;a href=&quot;https://crates.io/&quot;&gt;crates.io&lt;/a&gt; registry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are even offline built-in docs that you can get by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustup docs&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;rustup docs --book&lt;/code&gt; which is amazing. Thanks to Mohamed ELIDRISSI for &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/mohamedelidrissi_98/comment/hf85&quot;&gt;pointing it&lt;/a&gt; out to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;concurrency&quot;&gt;Concurrency&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rust has first-class support for memory safe concurrent programming. Rust uses threads for concurrency and has 1:1 threading implementation. i.e, 1 green thread per operating system thread. Rust compiler guarantees memory safety while using the threads. It provides features like waiting for all threads to finish, sharing data with &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;move&lt;/code&gt; closures or channels(similar to Go). It also lets you use shared state and sync threads.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;macros-and-meta-programming&quot;&gt;Macros and meta-programming&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While I don’t like all aspects of macros in Rust, there are more things to like here than dislike. The annotation macros, for example, are quite handy. Not a fan of the procedure macros though. For advanced users, you can write your own macro rules and do metaprogramming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;traits&quot;&gt;Traits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Traits are synonymous to interfaces in Java, it is used to define shared behaviors that can be implemented on structs. Traits can even specify default methods. The only thing I dislike here is the indirect implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;ability-to-use-unsafe-features-if-required&quot;&gt;Ability to use unsafe features if required&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Useful in advanced use-cases where you know what you are doing. A necessary evil IMO. I like it since its doable only within an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;unsafe { }&lt;/code&gt; block making it very explicit. I would have moved this to the dislike section if that was not the case.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you use these, the Rust compiler cannot guarantee memory and runtime safety and you are on your own to get this right. So definitely for advanced and experienced users.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;what-i-dont-like-about-rust&quot;&gt;What I don’t like about Rust&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Things that I didn’t like very much, in no particular order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;complexity&quot;&gt;Complexity&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t like it when a language offers multiples ways to do the same things. This is one think Golang does pretty well, there are no two ways to do the same thing and hence it is easier for people to work on larger codebases and to review code. Also, you don’t have to always think of the best possible way to do something. Unfortunately, Rust does this and I’m not a fan of it. IMO it makes the language more complex.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Too many ways for iterations -&amp;gt; loops, while, for, iterators.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Too many ways for creating procedures -&amp;gt; Functions, closures, macros&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Based on discussions here and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dua0qv/my_first_impressions_of_rust/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;, I say my perception of complexity only have increased. It seems like once you get past all the niceties there are a lot of things that would take some time to wrap your head around. I’m pretty sure if you are experienced in Rust, it would be a cakewalk for you but the language indeed is quite complex, especially the ways functions and closures behave in different contexts, lifetimes in structs and stuff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;shadowing-of-variables-in-the-same-context&quot;&gt;Shadowing of variables in the same context&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Rust lets you do this&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-rust highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;hello&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;world&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nd&quot;&gt;println!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;{}&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;foo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Kind of beats being immutable by default(I understand the reasoning of being able to perform transformations on an immutable variable, especially when passing references to a function and getting it back)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;IMO lets people practice bad practices unintentionally, I would have rather marked the variable mutable as I consider the above mutation as well.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;You can as easily accidentally shadow a variable as you would accidentally mutate one in Languages like JavaScript&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Gives people a gun to shoot in the foot&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; I saw a lot of comments here and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dua0qv/my_first_impressions_of_rust/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt; explaining why this is good. While I agree that it is useful in many scenarios, so is the ability of mutation. I think it would have been perfectly fine not to have this and people would have still loved Rust and all of them would have defended the decision not have this. So my opinion on this hasn’t changed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functions-are-not-first-class-citizens&quot;&gt;Functions are not first-class citizens&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While it is possible to pass a function to another they are not exactly first-class citizens like in JavaScript or Golang. &lt;del&gt;You cannot create closures from functions and you cannot assign functions to variables&lt;/del&gt;. Closures are separate from functions in Rust, they are quite similar to Java lambdas from what I see. While closures would be sufficient to perform some of the functional style programming patterns it would have been much nicer if it was possible using just functions thus making language a bit more simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Edit:&lt;/strong&gt; Oh by! this opinion triggered a lot of discussions here and on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dua0qv/my_first_impressions_of_rust/&quot;&gt;Reddit&lt;/a&gt;. So seems like Functions and closures are similar and different based on context, It also seems like Functions are almost like first-class citizens, but if you are used to languages like Go or JavaScript where functions are much more straight forward then you are in for a crazy ride. Functions in Rust seems much much more complex. A lot of people who commented seemed to miss the fact that my primary complaint was that having two constructs(closures and functions) that look and act quite similar in most of the scenarios makes things more complex. At least in Java and JS where there are multiple constructs(arrow functions, lambdas) those where due to the fact that they were added much later to the language and those are still something I don’t like in those languages. The best &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/louy2/comment/hjeo&quot;&gt;explanation&lt;/a&gt; was from &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/louy2&quot;&gt;Yufan Lou&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/rust/comments/dua0qv/my_first_impressions_of_rust/f77w23i/&quot;&gt;another&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/user/zesterer/&quot;&gt;zesterer&lt;/a&gt;. I’m not gonna remove this from stuff I don’t like since I still don’t like the complexity here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;implicit-implementation-of-traits&quot;&gt;Implicit implementation of traits&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not a fan of implicit stuff as its easier to abuse this and harder to read. You could define a struct in one file and you could implement a trait for that struct in another file which makes it less obvious. I prefer when the implementation is done by intent like in Java which makes it more obvious and easier to follow. While the way in Rust is not ideal, it is definitely better than Golang which is even more indirect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;nitpicks&quot;&gt;Nitpicks&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally some stuff I still don’t like but I don’t consider them a big deal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;del&gt;I don’t see the point of having the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword when &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; is immutable by default. It seems more like syntax sugar for the old school constants concept.&lt;/del&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/artemis&quot;&gt;Diane&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/artemis/comment/hf2c&quot;&gt;pointed out&lt;/a&gt; the difference &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; provides and that makes sense.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The block expression and implicit return style are a bit error-prone and confusing to get used to, I would have preferred explicit return. Also, it’s not that readable IMO.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If you have read my other post about Go, you might know that I’m not a fan of structs. Structs in Rust is very similar to structs in Golang. So like in Go, it would be easy to achieve unreadable struct structures. But fortunately, the structs in Rust seem much nicer than Go as you have functions, can use spread operator, shorthand syntax and so on here. Also, you can make structs which are Tuples. The structs in Rust are more like Java POJOs. I would have moved this to the liked section if having optional fields in structs where easier. Currently, you would have to wrap stuff in an &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Optional&lt;/code&gt; enum to do this. Also lifetimes :(&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Given strings are the most used data types, it would have been nice to have a simpler way of working with strings(like in Golang) rather than working with the Vector types for mutable strings or slice types for immutable string literals. This makes code more verbose than it needs to be. This is more likely a compromise due to the fact that Rust is not garbage collected and has a concept of ownership to manage memory. https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/std/str.html - &lt;strong&gt;Edit&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;I have moved this point to nitpicks rather than dislikes after a &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/robertorojasr/comment/hf27&quot;&gt;discussion&lt;/a&gt; on the comments with &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/robertorojasr&quot;&gt;robertorojasr&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like programming languages that focus more on simplicity rather than fancy syntax sugars and complex features. In my post &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/my-reflections-on-golang-38jk&quot;&gt;“My reflections on Golang”&lt;/a&gt;, I explain why I consider Golang to be too simple for my taste. Rust, on the other hand, is leaning towards the other side of the spectrum. While it is not as complex as Scala it is not as simple as Go as well. So its somewhere in between, not exactly the sweet spot but almost near that quite close to where JavaScript is maybe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So overall I can say that there are more things in Rust for me to like than to dislike which is what I would expect from a nice programming language. Also, bear in mind that I’m not saying Rust should do anything differently or that there are better ways to do things that I complained about. I’m just saying that I don’t like those things but I can live with it given the overall advantages. Also, I fully understand why some of those concepts are the way they are, those are mostly tradeoffs to focus on memory safety and performance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But don’t be fooled by what you see over the hood, Rust is definitely not something you should start with as your first programming language IMO, as it has a quite a lot of complex concepts and constructs underneath but if you are already familiar with programming then it shouldn’t be an issue after banging your head on the doors a few times :P&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So far I can say that I like Rust more than Golang even without implementing a real project with it and might choose Rust over Go for system programming use cases and for high-performance requirements.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Microservices - the good, bad, and the ugly</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;So you are attending this awesome conference where speaker after speaker talks about how awesome microservices are. You hear a speaker from a Tech giant presenting how they scaled up and solved their issues using microservices running on containers or something, and you wonder shouldn’t we do the same as well?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The reality is that there is no silver bullet in software engineering. Microservices doesn’t magically solve every scaling issues, some times they introduce more problems then they solve.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, this is not a microservice bashing post, as someone who likes microservice architectures(sometimes for their sheer complexity and sometimes for the ingenuity), I think it’s important to know the cost of doing microservice architectures in real-world use cases. I talked briefly about this in my &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/full-stack-development-jhipster&quot;&gt;book&lt;/a&gt; as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;microservice-architectures&quot;&gt;Microservice architectures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a microservice architecture, you generally split your domain model into individual loosely coupled services that can be deployed and scaled individually.
Each of the services is in itself a small application with its own architecture and even runtime sometimes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The services might offer REST endpoints that can be aggregated by an application acting as a gateway or the services could be communicating with each other using a messaging system. Some services might have  Web GUI some are headless services offering just an API.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In microservice architectures, each service is responsible for handling its data and ideally do not share database schema with other services. 
Such architectures make it easy to provide different clients for Mobile and Desktop experience which can be scaled independently based on demand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/8qgu7ue5togsslflganb.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Monolith vs Microservice architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are different architecture patterns for building microservices. The patterns used also decides the way services communicate and the way they are aggregated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://microservices.io/patterns/microservices.html&quot;&gt;This&lt;/a&gt; article details some of these patterns quite nicely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let’s break down the benefits and issues of microservice architecture and see when it makes sense to adopt one and when to avoid one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;general-benefits-of-microservice-architectures&quot;&gt;General benefits of Microservice architectures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Microservices provide(As it depends on how you actually implement it) or at least promise the below benefits, which can be grouped into three major categories&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;loose-coupling&quot;&gt;Loose coupling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Microservice components are more loosely coupled than traditional architectures. 
Such systems employ event-driven or message-driven architectures to achieve communication between loosely coupled components.
This results in better isolation of components and makes it easy to unit test them and faster to startup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Such systems also provide other benefits like, for example, a memory leak in one of the services, are isolated and hence will not bring down the entire application. Hence overall single point of failures are reduced&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Loosely coupled individual components will start up much faster than a big monolith making it possible to parallelize and improve overall start-up for large systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also makes it easy to refactor existing features as you can gradually refactor things rather than having to refactor an entire system in one go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because of such loose coupling, each service can choose to use a database/datastore that is more appropriate whereas in a monolith you might compromise with a single database type.
For example, a service dealing with a lot of unstructured data can choose a NoSQL database while a service that is handling transactions or structured data can opt for a SQL database.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;faster-development--release-cycle&quot;&gt;Faster development &amp;amp; release cycle&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a well-implemented microservice architecture, development turnaround is faster and hence you get a better time to market for new features and easier refactoring of existing features.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A complex problem domain can be easily tackled by splitting it into separately manageable services making it easier to understand and maintain in the long run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology adoption is easier, components can be independently upgraded in incremental migration making it possible to have a different stack for each component.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is also possible to have different microservices in a system use different implementation languages and just communicate using a common messaging format like gRPC or a message queue or pub/sub, 
thus making it possible to have teams with different language skills hence less dependency on a single language or stack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Teams will be less dependent on each other as communication between systems is governed by a public API or contract letting you change internals without having to worry about breaking someone else’s code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Best suited for agile teams. Such teams can have better focus as they only need to worry about a single service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;fine-grained-scaling&quot;&gt;Fine-grained scaling&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the most important benefits of a microservice architecture is the ability to scale individual components based on load. 
If implemented properly this will result in ideal load distribution and reduced overall infrastructure cost. 
Services with more demand can be scaled up while the ones with less demand can be scaled down utilizing infrastructure more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Deploying services independently also makes the application more reliable and makes patching easier as you do not have to upgrade the entire application to fix an issue in a single service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More complex and efficient scaling models can be established. Critical services can be scaled more effectively. Infrastructure is used more efficiently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Continuous delivery of such complex applications also would be easier than its equivalent monolith as components are smaller and any issue in deployment can be investigated easily and rectified on a per-component basis&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;general-issues-with-microservice-architectures&quot;&gt;General issues with microservice architectures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well with any architectures, there are disadvantages of Microservice architectures as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;complexity&quot;&gt;Complexity&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Complexity is one of the biggest side effects of this architecture. While microservices can reduce the domain complexity by breaking the problem into smaller services,
there could be complexities of a distributed system in terms of;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Overall stack as different components might have different technology stacks forcing the team to invest more time in keeping up with them.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Scaling is more efficient but it would require advanced features such as service discovery, DNS routing, and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Communication between components might require a messaging system(Queue, PubSub, Event store).&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Business transactions on a distributed system might involve updating multiple databases making rollbacks more complex and error-prone.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;The entire application is more complex to deploy as there are complexities with containers, orchestration, and virtualization involved.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Requires a complex infrastructure. Most often will require containers (Docker), Orchestration(Kubernetes) and multiple JVM or app containers to run on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;integration-testing&quot;&gt;Integration testing&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End-to-end tests and integration tests become harder to perform there are more moving parts in the stack and more complex communication between components.
The testing infrastructure required also becomes more difficult to set up and maintain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;team-size-and-experience&quot;&gt;Team size and experience&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The technical stack for microservices is more complex and most of the time harder to learn and hence it would demand a more experienced team with more senior-level skillset than that would be required for a similar monolithic application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It will also require a bigger team to maintain the application as there are more components and more technologies involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Implementing requirements that span multiple services would require more upfront time to agree on contracts and APIs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Team members share varying skill sets based on the component they work on but might not be having a birds-eye view of the entire application making business requirements harder to visualize and cross-cutting issues harder to fix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;overhead&quot;&gt;Overhead&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Complex microservices will have the additional overhead of running monitoring setup, messaging services, orchestration, service registry and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Initial development time will be higher due to the complexity making time to market slower.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The overall cost of the initial infrastructure might be much higher than that of a similar monolith.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In microservice architectures, there is always code duplication between services which also can be considered overhead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;when-you-should-not-be-considering-microservice-architectures&quot;&gt;When you should not be considering Microservice architectures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You should not be using microservice architecture unless you absolutely have to, remember not every application has the same scale requirements as Netflix, Google, Amazon or Spotify. 
Many of the benefits that microservices provide to these kinds of applications are due to their sheer scale which might not be applicable to you. 
So here are some reasons not to choose microservices and maybe stick to monoliths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When your application’s scope is small and you know that it’s not going to grow and turn into something like Facebook. For well defined simple usecases a monolith is always the best fit. Examples are
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A CRUD application for an internal use case in a company.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;A small application with a very niche user base. Like a shopping site for some specialty items.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the time to market is critical for a new application. The initial time to market would be higher for microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When the size of your team is small or the average experience of the team is less. Its best to start with a monolith when you are a small or inexperienced team.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When your infrastructure budget is limited. Though on long-run microservice might help to save money, in the beginning, it is going to cost you more.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most importantly do not choose microservices because it is the hype or because it is used by a popular company or because it was suggested by a popular person. For most use cases monoliths are still a great solution and even if you start with a monolith you can always split away into microservices if required.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;when-you-could-consider-microservice-architectures&quot;&gt;When you could consider Microservice architectures&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In general, Microservices tend to be beneficial if you have one of the below scenarios.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When your use case domain is complex, you have a large team with experience and splitting it up would make it easier to implement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you are expecting to become the next Facebook, Netflix or Twitter in terms of user load. So ideally when you are expecting an exponential user base.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;If your application is going to be an API provider for other applications with a large userbase. Like a payment gateway or inventory service that will be used by a social media application&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;When you have a popular e-commerce application with a large userbase with an uneven load on different services in the application. Its time to split them into microservices.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So in conclusion, don’t choose an architecture pattern because it works for someone else, choose a pattern that is appropriate for your use case, scale and requirements. 
Not everyone needs to handle millions of concurrent users or stream terabytes of data.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Easy functional programming techniques in TypeScript for everyone</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of hype around functional programming(FP) and a lot of cool kids are doing it but it is not a silver bullet. Like other programming paradigms/styles, functional programming also has its pros and cons and one may prefer one paradigm over the other. If you are a TypeScript/JavaScript developer and wants to venture into functional programming, do not worry, you don’t have to learn functional programming oriented languages like Haskell or Clojure since JavaScript and hence TypeScript has you covered and this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for functional programming in Java or Golang check other posts in the series.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not gonna dive into all functional programming concepts in detail, instead, I’m gonna focus on things that you can do in TypeScript which are in line with functional programming concepts. I’m also not gonna discuss the pros and cons of functional programming in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind, though this post is about TypeScript, you can easily do the same in JavaScript as well since TypeScript is just a typed superset of JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-functional-programming&quot;&gt;What is functional programming?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence in functional programming, there are two very important rules&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Data mutations&lt;/strong&gt;: It means a data object should not be changed after it is created.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No implicit state&lt;/strong&gt;: Hidden/Implicit state should be avoided. In functional programming state is not eliminated, instead, its made visible and explicit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No side effects&lt;/strong&gt;: A function or operation should not change any state outside of its functional scope. I.e, A function should only return a value to the invoker and should not affect any external state. This means programs are easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure functions only&lt;/strong&gt;: Functional code is idempotent. A function should return values only based on the arguments passed and should not affect(side-effect) or depend on global state. Such functions always produce the same result for the same arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these there are functional programming concepts below that can be applied in TypeScript, we will touch upon these further down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function&quot;&gt;Higher-order-functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;Closures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying&quot;&gt;Currying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;Recursion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy&quot;&gt;Lazy evaluations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency&quot;&gt;Referential transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using functional programming doesn’t mean its all or nothing, you can always use functional programming concepts to complement Object-oriented concepts in TypeScript. The benefits of functional programming can be utilized whenever possible regardless of the paradigm or language you use. And that is exactly what we are going to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functional-programming-in-typescript&quot;&gt;Functional programming in TypeScript&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TypeScript is not a purely functional language but offers a lot of concepts which are in line with functional languages, so let us see how we can apply some of the functional programming concepts above in TypeScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-class-and-higher-order-functions&quot;&gt;First-class and higher-order functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First-class functions(function as a first-class citizen) means you can assign functions to variables, pass a function as an argument to another function or return a function from another. TypeScript supports this and hence makes concepts like closures, currying, and higher-order-functions easy to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function can be considered as a higher-order-function only if it takes one or more functions as parameters or if it returns another function as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In TypeScript, this is quite easy to do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The higher-order-function takes an array and a function as arguments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mapForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[],&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mapFn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// We are executing the method passed&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;newArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Banana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Grape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// we are passing the array and a function as arguments to mapForEach method.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;mapForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// [6, 5, 6, 5]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But then in JavaScript/TypeScript we could also simply do it this way using built-in functional methods like map, reduce and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Banana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Grape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// we are passing a function as arguments to the built-in map method.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;length&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// [6, 5, 6, 5]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closures and currying are also possible in TypeScript&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this is a higher-order-function that returns a function&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// A function is returned here as closure&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// variable x is obtained from the outer scope of this method and memorized in the closure&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// we are currying the add method to create more variations&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add30&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 15&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 25&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 35&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also many built-in declarative higher-order-functions in TypeScript/JavaScript like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; and so on. There are also many libraries that provide functional interfaces to be used in TypeScript/JavaScript.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pure-functions&quot;&gt;Pure functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw already a pure function should return values only based on the arguments passed and should not affect or depend on global state. It is possible to do this in TypeScript easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite simple, take the below this is a pure function. It will always return the same output for the given input and its behavior is highly predictable. We can safely cache the method if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we add an extra line in this function, the behavior becomes unpredictable as it now has a side effect that affects an external state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;holder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{};&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;let&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;holder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;${&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;`&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So try to keep your functions pure and simple. Using tools like &lt;a href=&quot;https://eslint.org/&quot;&gt;ESLint&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint&quot;&gt;typescript-eslint&lt;/a&gt; it is possible to enforce these.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recursion&quot;&gt;Recursion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming favors recursion over looping. Let us see an example for calculating the factorial of a number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional iterative approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

        &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be done using recursion as below which is favored in functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of the recursive approach is that it will be slower compared to an iterative approach most of the times(The advantage we are aiming for is code simplicity and readability) and might result in stack overflow errors since every function call needs to be saved as a frame to the stack. To avoid this tail recursion is preferred, especially when the recursion is done too many times. In tail recursion, the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function and hence the functions stack frame need not be saved by the compiler. Most compilers can optimize the tail recursion code the same way iterative code is optimized hence avoiding the performance penalty. Tail call optimization is part of the ECMAScript specs but unfortunately, most JavaScript engines do not support this yet.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now using tail recursion the same function can be written as below, but depending on the engine this might not be optimized, though there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.logrocket.com/using-trampolines-to-manage-large-recursive-loops-in-javascript-d8c9db095ae3/&quot;&gt;workarounds&lt;/a&gt;, still it performed better in benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;factorialTailRec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider using recursion when writing TypeScript code for readability and immutability, but if performance is critical or if the number of iterations will be huge use standard loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lazy-evaluation&quot;&gt;Lazy evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazy evaluation or non-strict evaluation is the process of delaying evaluation of an expression until it is needed. In general, TypeScript does strict/eager evaluation but for operands like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; it does a lazy evaluation. We can utilize short-circuiting, higher-order-functions, closures, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization&quot;&gt;memoization&lt;/a&gt; techniques to do lazy evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this example where TypeScript eagerly evaluates everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;executing add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this is printed since the functions are evaluated first&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;executing multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this is printed since the functions are evaluated first&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;function&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addOrMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;):&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;number&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addOrMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 8&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;console&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;log&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;addOrMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 16&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will produce the below output and we can see that both functions are executed always&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;executing add

16
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use higher-order-functions to rewrite this into a lazily evaluated version&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outputs the below and we can see that only required functions were executed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outputs the below and we can see that functions were executed only once for the same values&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;executing add
executing multiply
8
16
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please note that memoization techniques will work only when your functions are pure and referentially transparent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also other ways of doing Lazy evaluations like &lt;a href=&quot;https://thoughts.travelperk.com/optimizing-js-with-lazy-evaluation-and-memoization-9d0cd8c30cd4&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Doing Lazy evaluations in TypeScript might not be worth the code complexity some of the times, but if the functions in question are heavy in terms of processing then its is absolutely worth it to lazy evaluate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-system&quot;&gt;Type system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;TypeScript has a strong type system and also has great type inference. While the underlying JavaScript itself is weakly typed, TypeScript along with a compatible IDE can bridge that gap.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;referential-transparency&quot;&gt;Referential transparency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Functional programs do not have assignment statements, that is, the value of a variable in a functional program never changes once defined. This eliminates any chances of side effects because any variable can be replaced with its actual value at any point of execution. So, functional programs are referentially transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are not many ways to strictly limit data mutation in JavaScript, however by using pure functions and by explicitly avoiding data mutations and reassignment using other concepts we saw earlier this can be achieved. JavaScript by default passes primitive variables by value and objects by reference so we need to take care not to mutate data inside functions. Libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/immutable-js/immutable-js&quot;&gt;Immutable JS&lt;/a&gt; could also be considered. Use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; as much as possible to avoid reassignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the below will produce an error&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Banana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Grape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Earth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Saturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this will not help when variables are holding references to other objects, for example, the below mutation will work irrespective of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Banana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Grape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Earth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// will mutate the list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Saturn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// will mutate the list&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword allows the internal state of referenced variables to be mutated and hence from a functional programming perspective &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;const&lt;/code&gt; keyword is useful only for primitive constants and to catch reassignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, with TypeScript, we can use special mapped types to make objects read-only and hence avoiding accidental data mutations which are caught during compile time. Thanks to @stereobooster and @juliang for pointing it out. Read my post about mapped and conditional types &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/react-components-done-right-with-typescript-mapped-and-conditional-types-420l&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; to learn more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Earth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// will cause compilation error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;or&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-typescript highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;ReadonlyArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Apple&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Orange&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Banana&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Grape&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;];&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nx&quot;&gt;push&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;Earth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;dl&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// will cause compilation error&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other techniques to follow are using &lt;a href=&quot;https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze&quot;&gt;Object.freeze&lt;/a&gt; or built-in methods like map, reduce, filter and so on as they do not mutate the data. We can also use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jfmengels/eslint-plugin-fp&quot;&gt;this ESlint plugin&lt;/a&gt; to restrict mutations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-structures&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_data_structure&quot;&gt;Data structures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using functional programming techniques it is encouraged to use data types such as Stacks, Maps and Queues which have functional implementations as well.
Hence maps are better than arrays or hash sets in functional programming as data stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just an introduction for those who are trying to apply some functional programming techniques in TypeScript. There are a lot more that can be done in TypeScript and with the ever-evolving ECMAScript underneath, this should be even easier. As I said earlier functional programming is not a silver bullet but it offers a lot of useful techniques for more understandable, maintainable and testable code. It can co-exist perfectly well with imperative and object-oriented programming styles. In fact, we all should be using the best of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>7 Easy functional programming techniques in Go</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of hype around functional programming(FP) and a lot of cool kids are doing it but it is not a silver bullet. Like other programming paradigms/styles, functional programming also has its pros and cons and one may prefer one paradigm over the other. If you are a Go developer and wants to venture into functional programming, do not worry, you don’t have to learn functional programming oriented languages like Haskell or Clojure(or even Scala or JavaScript though they are not pure functional programming languages) since Go has you covered and this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for functional programming in Java then check this out&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/functional-programming-in-java-a-primer-13nb &quot;&gt;https://dev.to/deepu105/functional-programming-in-java-a-primer-13nb &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not gonna dive into all functional programming concepts in detail, instead, I’m gonna focus on things that you can do in Go which are in line with functional programming concepts. I’m also not gonna discuss the pros and cons of functional programming in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-functional-programming&quot;&gt;What is functional programming?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence in functional programming, there are two very important rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Data mutations&lt;/strong&gt;: It means a data object should not be changed after it is created.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No implicit state&lt;/strong&gt;: Hidden/Implicit state should be avoided. In functional programming state is not eliminated, instead, its made visible and explicit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No side effects&lt;/strong&gt;: A function or operation should not change any state outside of its functional scope. I.e, A function should only return a value to the invoker and should not affect any external state. This means programs are easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure functions only&lt;/strong&gt;: Functional code is idempotent. A function should return values only based on the arguments passed and should not affect(side-effect) or depend on global state. Such functions always produce the same result for the same arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these there are functional programming concepts below that can be applied in Go, we will touch upon these further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function&quot;&gt;Higher-order-functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;Closures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying&quot;&gt;Currying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;Recursion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy&quot;&gt;Lazy evaluations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency&quot;&gt;Referential transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using functional programming doesn’t mean its all or nothing, you can always use functional programming concepts to complement Object-oriented or imperative concepts in Go. The benefits of functional programming can be utilized whenever possible regardless of the paradigm or language you use. And that is exactly what we are going to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functional-programming-in-go&quot;&gt;Functional programming in Go&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Golang is a multi-paradigm language so let us see how we can apply some of the functional programming concepts above in Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-class-and-higher-order-functions&quot;&gt;First-class and higher-order functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First-class functions(function as a first-class citizen) means you can assign functions to variables, pass a function as an argument to another function or return a function from another. Go supports this and hence makes concepts like closures, currying, and higher-order-functions easy to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function can be considered as a higher-order-function only if it takes one or more functions as parameters or if it returns another function as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Go, this is quite easy to do&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Orange&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Banana&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Grape&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// we are passing the array and a function as arguments to mapForEach method.&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;})&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// [6, 5, 6, 5]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// The higher-order-function takes an array and a function as arguments&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;mapForEach&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;_&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;range&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;arr&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// We are executing the method passed&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newArray&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;append&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newArray&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Closures and currying are also possible in Go&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// this is a higher-order-function that returns a function&lt;/span&gt;

		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// we are currying the add method to create more variations&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add10&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add20&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add30&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 15&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 25&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 35&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also many built-in higher-order-functions in Go standard libraries. There are also some functional style libraries like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wesovilabs/koazee&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yanatan16/itertools&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; offering map-reduce like functional methods in Go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pure-functions&quot;&gt;Pure functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw already a pure function should return values only based on the arguments passed and should not affect or depend on global state. It is possible to do this in Go easily.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite simple, take the below this is a pure function. It will always return the same output for the given input and its behavior is highly predictable. We can safely cache the method if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we add an extra line in this function, the behavior becomes unpredictable as it now has a side effect that affects an external state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;holder&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;holder&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Sprintf&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;%d+%d&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So try to keep your functions pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recursion&quot;&gt;Recursion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming favors recursion over looping. Let us see an example for calculating the factorial of a number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional iterative approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be done using recursion as below which is favored in functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of the recursive approach is that it will be slower compared to an iterative approach most of the times(The advantage we are aiming for is code simplicity and readability) and might result in stack overflow errors since every function call needs to be saved as a frame to the stack. To avoid this tail recursion is preferred, especially when the recursion is done too many times. In tail recursion, the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function and hence the functions stack frame need not be saved by the compiler. Most compilers can optimize the tail recursion code the same way iterative code is optimized hence avoiding the performance penalty. Go compiler, unfortunately, does not do this optimization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now using tail recursion the same function can be written as below, but Go doesn’t optimize this, though there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/golang/comments/3vndco/why_no_tail_call_elimination/cxphgqe/&quot;&gt;workarounds&lt;/a&gt;, still it performed better in benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;()&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorialTailRec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I ran some benchmarks with all 3 approaches and here is the result, as you can see looping is still the most performing followed by the tail recursion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;p&gt;Consider using recursion when writing Go code for readability and immutability, but if performance is critical or if the number of iterations will be huge use standard loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lazy-evaluation&quot;&gt;Lazy evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazy evaluation or non-strict evaluation is the process of delaying evaluation of an expression until it is needed. In general, Go does strict/eager evaluation but for operands like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; it does a lazy evaluation. We can utilize higher-order-functions, closures, goroutines, and channels to emulate lazy evaluations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this example where Go eagerly evaluates everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;addOrMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;4&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// 8&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;executing multiply&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// this is printed since the functions are evaluated first&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;addOrMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will produce the below output and we can see that both functions are executed always&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use higher-order-functions to rewrite this into a lazily evaluated version&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// This is now a higher-order-function hence evaluation of the functions are delayed in if-else&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;addOrMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;bool&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outputs the below and we can see that only required functions were executed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

16
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also other ways of doing it using Sync &amp;amp; Futures like &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.merovius.de/2015/07/17/lazy-evaluation-in-go.html&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; and using channels and goroutines like &lt;a href=&quot;https://gist.github.com/nickcarenza/0ac9057ad06036d1e934&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt;. Doing Lazy evaluations in Go might not be worth the code complexity most of the times, but if the functions in question are heavy in terms of processing then its is absolutely worth it to lazy evaluate them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-system&quot;&gt;Type system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go has a strong type system and also has pretty decent type inference. The only thing missing compared to other functional programming languages are something like case classes and pattern matching.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;referential-transparency&quot;&gt;Referential transparency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Functional programs do not have assignment statements, that is, the value of a variable in a functional program never changes once defined. This eliminates any chances of side effects because any variable can be replaced with its actual value at any point of execution. So, functional programs are referentially transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are not many ways to strictly limit data mutation in Go, however by using pure functions and by explicitly avoiding data mutations and reassignment using other concepts we saw earlier this can be achieved. Go by default passes variables by value, except for slices and maps. So, avoid passing them by reference(using pointers) as much as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the below will mutate external state as we are passing a parameter by reference and hence doesn’t ensure referential transparency&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-go highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fullName&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;age&lt;/span&gt;       &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getFullName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fullName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// data mutation&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fullName&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;john&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;john&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;doe&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getFullName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;john&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// johndoe&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;john&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;// {john doe johndoe 30}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we pass parameters by the value we can ensure referential transparency even if there is an accidental mutation of passed data within the function&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getFullName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;func&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;string&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fullName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;firstName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;lastName&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;in&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fullName&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;john&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Person&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
		&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;john&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;doe&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;m&quot;&gt;30&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;getFullName&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;john&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
	&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;fmt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;john&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We cannot rely on this when passed parameters are maps or slices.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-structures&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_data_structure&quot;&gt;Data structures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using functional programming techniques it is encouraged to use functional data types such as Stacks, Maps and Queues. 
Hence maps are better than arrays or hash sets in functional programming as data stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just an introduction for those who are trying to apply some functional programming techniques in Go. There are a lot more that can be done in Go and with the addition of generics in the next major version, this should be even easier. As I said earlier functional programming is not a silver bullet but it offers a lot of useful techniques for more understandable, maintainable and testable code. It can co-exist perfectly well with imperative and object-oriented programming styles. In fact, we all should be using the best of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Static Site Generators rundown - How I set up my own blog with Jekyll</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Last month I decided to move my blogs from &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@deepu105&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105&quot;&gt;Dev.to&lt;/a&gt;, I have detailed the reasons in the below post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/why-i-m-moving-away-from-medium-13ki &quot;&gt;https://dev.to/deepu105/why-i-m-moving-away-from-medium-13ki &lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A lot of people suggested in the comments to set up my own blog and cross-post to Dev.to instead of relying only on one platform and I completely agree with them. I was procrastinating setting up my own blog for quite some time now. Finally, I decided to do it and set up my own blog at &lt;a href=&quot;https://deepu.tech/blogs/&quot;&gt;https://deepu.tech/blogs/&lt;/a&gt; in the process I also updated my personal website to use the same platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So when I decided to do this finally I had to choose a blogging platform and there were few requirements I was keen about which influenced my decision.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;requirements&quot;&gt;Requirements&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The platform should support writing posts using &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown&quot;&gt;Markdown&lt;/a&gt; with code syntax highlights&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I love the Dev community and hence wanted to cross-post everything to &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105&quot;&gt;Dev.to&lt;/a&gt; as well without having to make any changes to the post. Means I would author once and publish to both my blog and Dev. This means some constraints/requirements
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It should support customizable &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/front-matter/&quot;&gt;front matter&lt;/a&gt; so that I can align it with Dev&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;It should support the &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/new#liquidtags&quot;&gt;custom liquid tags&lt;/a&gt; used by Dev or I should be able to easily add those&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I should be able to have custom pages for my personal website&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should be open source and have a good stable community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should be theme-able, have plugins for SEO, search and so on&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should be statically generated and reasonably fast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Should be able to host using GitHub pages - This was an optional requirement&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-options-rundown&quot;&gt;The options rundown&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With these in mind, I started evaluating some of the popular options below.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jekyll&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have experience with Jekyll since I built the new &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jhipster.tech/&quot;&gt;JHipster website&lt;/a&gt; using it&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports Markdown, Liquid tags and Front Matter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports custom pages, themes, plugins and is statically generated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is OSS and has a vibrant community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be hosted on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I would have to build or find replacements for the custom Liquid tags used by Dev&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I don’t have much experience with Ruby and I’m not very familiar with the Ruby ecosystem&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not the fastest among the options. Becomes slower as site size increases&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;hugo&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://gohugo.io/&quot;&gt;Hugo&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is very fast&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I have extensive experience with Go and Go templates which would be helpful&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports Markdown and Front Matter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports custom pages, themes and is statically generated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is OSS and has a vibrant community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be hosted on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doesn’t support Liquid tags&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doesn’t have plugins. The built-in options are enough for my requirements at the moment though&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;vuepress&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://vuepress.vuejs.org/&quot;&gt;VuePress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built with VueJS and I have good experience with JavaScript and quite familiar with Vue&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports Markdown and Front Matter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports custom pages, themes, SEO, search and is statically generated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is OSS and has a vibrant community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be hosted on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doesn’t support Liquid tags&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doesn’t have plugins. The built-in options are enough for my requirements at the moment though&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Not geared towards blogging, but it’s possible to do it easily with some hacking&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;gatsby&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gatsbyjs.org&quot;&gt;Gatsby&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Pros:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Built with React and I have good experience with React&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports Markdown and Front Matter&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports custom pages, themes, plugins and is statically generated&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is OSS and has a vibrant community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be hosted on GitHub&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doesn’t support Liquid tags&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;wordpress&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://wordpress.org/&quot;&gt;WordPress&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pros&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Have used it in the past and is a battle-tested solution&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports Markdown using plugins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports custom pages, themes, plugins and can be statically generated using plugins&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Is OSS and has a vibrant community&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Can be hosted on GitHub with some workarounds&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cons&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Doesn’t support Front Matter and Liquid tags&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Since most of my core requirements can only be achieved using plugins and workarounds it feels too clumsy&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though I personally liked Hugo because of its speed, based on the above the most logical choice for me was &lt;strong&gt;Jekyll&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;building-a-personal-website-and-blog-with-jekyll&quot;&gt;Building a personal website and blog with Jekyll&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;getting-started&quot;&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Setting up Jekyll is super easy, I followed the official guide and had a site up and running in minutes. The steps in order were as below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install a full &lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/&quot;&gt;Ruby development environment&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Install Jekyll and bundler gems for my user - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gem install jekyll bundler --user-install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Create a new site - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll new DeepuKSasidharan --skip-bundle&lt;/code&gt;, skipped the bundle install as I want to install to a vendor folder&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cd into the folder &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DeepuKSasidharan&lt;/code&gt; and install gems to a vendor folder - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install --path vendor/bundle --full-index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start server - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; and go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;using-a-theme&quot;&gt;Using a Theme&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Up next was setting up a custom theme, since I really like the minimal design of Medium, I decided to use &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll&quot;&gt;Mediumish Jekyll Theme &lt;/a&gt; so I did the below steps to switch to this. Steps 3-5 above can be skipped and instead step 2 from the below can be done directly as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Delete the folder &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DeepuKSasidharan&lt;/code&gt; we created above&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Clone the theme to this folder - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;git clone https://github.com/wowthemesnet/mediumish-theme-jekyll.git DeepuKSasidharan&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cd into the folder &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DeepuKSasidharan&lt;/code&gt; and install gems to a vendor folder - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle install --path vendor/bundle --full-index&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Customize the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;_config.yaml&lt;/code&gt; file with my own user details, Google Analytics, Disqus ID and so on
    &lt;ol&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;I had to update the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;exclude&lt;/code&gt; section to add &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;vendor/&lt;/code&gt; to it and to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; as well&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Updated the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll-paginate&lt;/code&gt; plugin to &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll-paginate-v2&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;plugins&lt;/code&gt; section&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Commented out the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;baseurl&lt;/code&gt; section&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ol&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Start server - &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;bundle exec jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt; and go to &lt;a href=&quot;http://localhost:4000&quot;&gt;http://localhost:4000&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;customizations&quot;&gt;Customizations&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now I had a good looking website with an about page and blog up and running. I customized the look and feel a bit and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deepu105/deepu105.github.io/commit/9c6cb31f9b0c5643f350f3d9e685f37e3a3eed6d&quot;&gt;changed&lt;/a&gt; the default page from &lt;strong&gt;blogs&lt;/strong&gt; to &lt;strong&gt;about&lt;/strong&gt;. You can check the source code at &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deepu105/deepu105.github.io&quot;&gt;deepu105/deepu105.github.io&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now the next challenge was to make sure I can author once and post to both my blog and Dev.to, this means I have to make sure the front matter supported by Dev.to also works on my blog and any custom Liquid tags from Dev I use in the blog needs to work on my site as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part was easy, I just had to customize my sites includes and layouts to use &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cover_image&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;image&lt;/code&gt; and use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;tag: []&lt;/code&gt; syntax for tags.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also added support for Dev.to like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deepu105/deepu105.github.io/commit/1afe488da43e8588b2b8c02648229a08f8e93e0e&quot;&gt;series&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deepu105/deepu105.github.io/commit/4e06234c30b61569b0e859d0136f92437eca49c4&quot;&gt;read time&lt;/a&gt; with a custom ruby plugin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;adding-custom-liquid-tags&quot;&gt;Adding custom liquid tags&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to use Dev.to tags, first I tried if I can reuse them from Dev since its OSS, but it seems like they are heavily coupled with Rails and internal models to be extracted into Gems. I created a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/thepracticaldev/dev.to/issues/3491&quot;&gt;ticket&lt;/a&gt; asking for it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So decided to write my own Liquid tags in Ruby. I reused available OSS Liquid tags and customized them to work like the Dev.to ones in syntax and feature. I ended up creating the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;codesandbox&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;twitter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;gist&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;link&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;speakerdeck&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/code&gt; tags. You can find them &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/deepu105/deepu105.github.io/tree/site_src/_plugins&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. Probably will add more as I use them. This is not scalable and I would love to see the Dev.to tags published as Ruby gems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, here is a simple stub for the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;youtube&lt;/code&gt; tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-ruby highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

     &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;# A simple stub for the Dev.to youtube tag&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;class&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;YoutubeTag&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Tag&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;initialize&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;tokens&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;super&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;@id&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;id&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;render&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;context&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;sx&quot;&gt;%(&amp;lt;p&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;div class=&quot;embed-video-container&quot;&amp;gt;
                &amp;lt;iframe width=&quot;710&quot; height=&quot;399&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/#{@id}&quot; allowfullscreen&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/iframe&amp;gt;
            &amp;lt;/div&amp;gt;
        &amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
      &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;

  &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Liquid&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Template&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;register_tag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'youtube'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;::&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;YoutubeTag&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;publishing-to-github&quot;&gt;Publishing to GitHub&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that I have a site up and running with markdown posts that work in both my blog and Dev.to without having to make any adjustments, I decided to publish this to my Github accounts Github pages.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there was an issue here. Github doesn’t allow running any custom Ruby code on GitHub pages, so I can’t just push to GitHub and get the site built and published so I decided to write a simple script to do the site generation on my machine from the source branch and push it to the master branch on GitHub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-rf&lt;/span&gt; _site

&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;if&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-z&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;git status &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--porcelain&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;then

    git checkout master
    find &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-mindepth&lt;/span&gt; 1 &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-depth&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-print0&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-vEzZ&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'(temp(/|$)|vendor(/|$)|\.git(/|$)|/\.gitignore$)'&lt;/span&gt; | xargs &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-0&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-rvf&lt;/span&gt;

    git add &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--all&lt;/span&gt;
    git commit &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-am&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Updated site on &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    git push origin master &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--force&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$now&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;: Published changes to GitHub&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

    git checkout site_src
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;else
    &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;echo&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Working directory is not clean. Commit changes!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;exit
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;fi&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-current-workflow&quot;&gt;My current workflow&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So now that I have things in place, I author posts as markdown with a full front matter like below and publish on my blog first. Then I publish the same to Dev.to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;---
title: &quot;Static Site Generators rundown - How I set up my own blog with Jekyll&quot;
published: false

---
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not using the RSS import option in Dev as it uses the rendered blog and hence might need adjustments. I also set the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;canonical_url&lt;/code&gt; to my blog site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;future-plans&quot;&gt;Future plans&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some things that can be improved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the Dev.to API to publish this direct from my publish script when I author a new post or make updates to an existing one.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improve the link tag and add some more tags for GitHub.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use local assets image for my own blog and generate the image URL for Dev.to when publishing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Currently, all links point to Dev.to, make the link tag smart enough to point to my blog when published to my site(I don’t want my readers to switch between sites). This might be a bit hard since Dev.to links have a random suffix.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

        <title>7 Functional programming techniques in Java - A primer</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;There is a lot of hype around functional programming(FP) and a lot of cool kids are doing it but it is not a silver bullet. Like other programming paradigms/styles, functional programming also has its pros and cons and one may prefer one paradigm over the other. If you are a Java developer and wants to venture into functional programming, do not worry, you don’t have to learn functional programming oriented languages like Haskell or Clojure(or even Scala or JavaScript though they are not pure functional programming languages) since Java has you covered and this post is for you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m not gonna dive into all functional programming concepts in detail, instead, I’m gonna focus on things that you can do in Java which are in line with functional programming concepts. I’m also not gonna discuss the pros and cons of functional programming in general.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-functional-programming&quot;&gt;What is functional programming?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per Wikipedia,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Functional programming is a programming paradigm—a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs—that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hence in functional programming, there are two very important rules&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No Data mutations&lt;/strong&gt;: It means a data object should not be changed after it is created.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No implicit state&lt;/strong&gt;: Hidden/Implicit state should be avoided. In functional programming state is not eliminated, instead, its made visible and explicit&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This means:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;No side effects&lt;/strong&gt;: A function or operation should not change any state outside of its functional scope. I.e, A function should only return a value to the invoker and should not affect any external state. This means programs are easier to understand.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pure functions only&lt;/strong&gt;: Functional code is idempotent. A function should return values only based on the arguments passed and should not affect(side-effect) or depend on global state. Such functions always produce the same result for the same arguments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apart from these there are functional programming concepts below that can be applied in Java, we will touch upon these further down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher-order_function&quot;&gt;Higher-order-functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)&quot;&gt;Closures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Currying&quot;&gt;Currying&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)&quot;&gt;Recursion&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evaluation_strategy&quot;&gt;Lazy evaluations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Referential_transparency&quot;&gt;Referential transparency&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using functional programming doesn’t mean its all or nothing, you can always use functional programming concepts to complement Object-oriented concepts, especially in Java. The benefits of functional programming can be utilized whenever possible regardless of the paradigm or language you use. And that is exactly what we are going to see.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;functional-programming-in-java&quot;&gt;Functional programming in Java&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So let us see how we can apply some of the functional programming concepts above in Java. We will be using Java 11 as it is the LTS version currently.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;first-class-and-higher-order-functions&quot;&gt;First-class and higher-order functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First-class functions(function as a first-class citizen) means you can assign functions to variables, pass a function as an argument to another function or return a function from another. Unfortunately, Java doesn’t support this and hence makes concepts like closures, currying and higher-order-functions less convenient to write.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest to first-class functions in Java is &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lambda-expressions-java-8/&quot;&gt;Lambda expressions&lt;/a&gt;. There are also some built-in functional interfaces like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Consumer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Predicate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Supplier&lt;/code&gt; and so on under the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;java.util.function&lt;/code&gt; package which can be used for functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A function can be considered as a higher-order-function only if it takes one or more functions as parameters or if it returns another function as a result. The closest to higher-order-functions we can get in Java is using Lambda expressions and built-in Functional interfaces.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the nicest looking way of doing higher-order-functions, but this is how it is in Java and its not that bad IMO.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;newArray&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;interface&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;FnFactory&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// The interface defines the contract for the anonymous class&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;S&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;execute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;it&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fortunately, can actually simplify the above example further using the built-in &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/code&gt; interface and using the lambda expression syntax.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using these concepts along with lambda expressions we can write closures and currying like below&lt;/p&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// this is a higher-order-function that returns an instance of Function interface&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are also many built-in higher-order-functions in Java for example here is the sort method from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;java.util.Collections&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// This can be simplified as &quot;Collections.sort(list, Comparator.naturalOrder());&quot;, I'm writing the expanded version for readability&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Collections&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;sort&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;compareTo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;});&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// [Apple, Banana, Grape, Orange]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Java stream API also provides many interesting higher-order-functions like forEach, map and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;pure-functions&quot;&gt;Pure functions&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we saw already a pure function should return values only based on the arguments passed and should not affect or depend on global state. It is possible to do this in Java except for some cases when there are checked exceptions involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is quite simple, take the below this is a pure function. It will always return the same output for the given input and its behavior is highly predictable. We can safely cache the method if needed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If we add an extra line in this function, the behavior becomes unpredictable as it now has a side effect that affects an external state.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;HashMap&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Integer&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;sum&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;put&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;a&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;+&quot;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;+&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;c&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So try to keep your functions pure and simple.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;recursion&quot;&gt;Recursion&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Functional programming favors recursion over looping. In Java, this can be achieved either by using the stream API or by writing recursive functions. Let us see an example for calculating the factorial of a number.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also ran a benchmark on these using &lt;a href=&quot;http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-performance/jmh.html&quot;&gt;JMH&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned the nanoseconds/operation below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In traditional iterative approach:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// benchmark 9.645 ns/op&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;--)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;result&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The same can be done using recursion as below which is favored in functional programming.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// benchmark 19.567 ns/op&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;factorialRec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;long&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorialRec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;num&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorialRec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The downside of the recursive approach is that it will be slower compared to an iterative approach most of the times(The advantage we are aiming for is code simplicity and readability) and might result in stack overflow errors since every function call needs to be saved as a frame to the stack. To avoid this tail recursion is preferred, especially when the recursion is done too many times. In tail recursion, the recursive call is the last thing executed by the function and hence the functions stack frame need not be saved by the compiler. Most compilers can optimize the tail recursion code the same way iterative code is optimized hence avoiding the performance penalty. Java compiler, unfortunately, does not do this optimization :(&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now using tail recursion the same function can be written as below, but Java doesn’t optimize this, though there are &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.knoldus.com/tail-recursion-in-java-8/&quot;&gt;workarounds&lt;/a&gt;, still it performed better in benchmarks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorial&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;accumulator&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;val&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;-&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;public&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;void&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;String&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;args&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;System&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;println&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;factorialTailRec&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;mi&quot;&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// 2432902008176640000&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can also use the Java stream library for recursion but its slower than normal recursion at the moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Consider using stream API or recursion when writing Java code for readability and immutability, but if performance is critical or if the number of iterations will be huge use standard loops.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;lazy-evaluation&quot;&gt;Lazy evaluation&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Lazy evaluation or non-strict evaluation is the process of delaying evaluation of an expression until it is needed. In general, Java does strict evaluation but for operands like &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;||&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;?:&lt;/code&gt; it does a lazy evaluation. We can utilize this to do lazy evaluations when writing java code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Take this example where Java eagerly evaluates everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;multiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

    &lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;static&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;addOrMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;boolean&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;int&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will produce the below output and we can see that both functions are executed always&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We can use lambda expressions and higher-order-functions to rewrite this into a lazily evaluated version&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Function&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;R&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;no&quot;&gt;T&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;{&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;// Java evaluates expressions on ?: lazily hence only the required method is executed&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onAdd&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;onMultiply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;apply&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;));&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This outputs the below and we can see that only required functions were executed&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;executing add
8
executing multiply
16
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;type-system&quot;&gt;Type system&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Java has a strong type system and with the introduction of the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;var&lt;/code&gt; keyword it now also has pretty decent type inference. The only thing missing compared to other functional programming languages are case classes. There are proposals for &lt;a href=&quot;http://cr.openjdk.java.net/~jrose/values/values-0.html&quot;&gt;value classes&lt;/a&gt; and case classes for future Java versions. Let’s hope they make it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;referential-transparency&quot;&gt;Referential transparency&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From Wikipedia:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Functional programs do not have assignment statements, that is, the value of a variable in a functional program never changes once defined. This eliminates any chances of side effects because any variable can be replaced with its actual value at any point of execution. So, functional programs are referentially transparent.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, there are not many ways to limit data mutation in Java, however by using pure functions and by explicitly avoiding data mutations and reassignment using other concepts we saw earlier this can be achieved. For variables, we can use the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/final-keyword-java/&quot;&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;final&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; keyword which is a non-access modifier to avoid mutations by reassignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For example, the below will produce an error at compilation&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Arrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;asList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Apple&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Orange&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Banana&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Grape&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;Arrays&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;asList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Earth&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Saturn&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But this will not help when variables are holding references to other objects, for example, the below mutation will work irrespective of the final keyword.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-java highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;kd&quot;&gt;final&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kt&quot;&gt;var&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;new&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nc&quot;&gt;ArrayList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;gt;();&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Test&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;list&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;na&quot;&gt;add&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s&quot;&gt;&quot;Test 2&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; keyword allows the internal state of referenced variables to be mutated and hence from a functional programming perspective &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;final&lt;/code&gt; keyword is useful only for constants and to catch reassignments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;data-structures&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purely_functional_data_structure&quot;&gt;Data structures&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When using functional programming techniques it is encouraged to use functional data types such as Stacks, Maps and Queues. 
Hence maps are better than arrays or hash sets in functional programming as data stores.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just an introduction for those who are trying to apply some functional programming techniques in Java. There are lot more that can be done in Java and Java 8 added a lot of API to make it easy to do functional programming in Java, like the stream API, Optional interface, functional interfaces and so on. As I said earlier functional programming is not a silver bullet but it offers a lot of useful techniques for more understandable, maintainable and testable code. It can co-exist perfectly well with imperative and object-oriented programming styles. In fact, we all should be using the best of everything.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This video from &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/venkat_s&quot;&gt;Venkat Subramaniam&lt;/a&gt; is a great resource to dive deep into functional programming in Java&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>How to set up Java microservices with Istio service mesh on Kubernetes</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Originally published at &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/free-code-camp/jhipster-microservices-with-istio-service-mesh-on-kubernetes-a7d0158ba9a3&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; on 17-Nov-2018. This post has been updated since to work with the latest version of JHipster(6.3.0) and Istio(1.3.0).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Istio is the coolest kid on the DevOps and Cloud block now. For those of you who aren’t following close enough — &lt;a href=&quot;https://istio.io/docs/concepts/what-is-istio/&quot;&gt;Istio&lt;/a&gt; is a service mesh for distributed application architectures, especially the ones that you run on the cloud with Kubernetes. Istio plays extremely nice with Kubernetes, so nice that you might think that it’s part of the Kubernetes platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are still wondering, what the heck is a service mesh or Istio? then let’s have an overview of Istio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;istio&quot;&gt;Istio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Istio provides the following functionality in a distributed application architecture:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Service discovery — Traditionally provided by platforms like &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/eureka/wiki&quot;&gt;Netflix Eureka &lt;/a&gt;or &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.consul.io/&quot;&gt;Consul&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Automatic load balancing — You might have used &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/zuul/wiki&quot;&gt;Netflix Zuul&lt;/a&gt; for this.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Routing, circuit breaking, retries, fail-overs, fault injection — Think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/ribbon/wiki&quot;&gt;Netflix Ribbon&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/Netflix/Hystrix&quot;&gt;Hytrix&lt;/a&gt; and so on.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Policy enforcement for access control, rate limiting, A/B testing, traffic splits, and quotas — Again you might have used Zuul to do some of these.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Metrics, logs, and traces — Think of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.elastic.co/elk-stack&quot;&gt;ELK&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/&quot;&gt;Stack driver&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Secure service-to-service communication&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is the architecture of Istio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2500/1*_STCerKXb4L3Hutyn4P5Gw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Istio architecture&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Istio architecture&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It can be classified into 2 distinct planes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Data plane&lt;/strong&gt;: Is made of &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.envoyproxy.io/&quot;&gt;Envoy&lt;/a&gt; proxies deployed as sidecars to the application containers. They control all the incoming and outgoing traffic to the container.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Control plane&lt;/strong&gt;: It uses Pilot to manages and configure the proxies to route traffic. It also configures Mixer to enforce policies and to collect telemetry. It also has other components like Citadel, to manage security, and Galley, to manage configurations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Istio can also configure an instance of &lt;a href=&quot;https://grafana.com/&quot;&gt;Grafana&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://prometheus.io/&quot;&gt;Prometheus&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.jaegertracing.io/&quot;&gt;Jaeger&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.kiali.io/&quot;&gt;Kiali&lt;/a&gt; for Monitoring and Observability. You can use this or use your existing monitoring stack as well if you wish to do so.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope this provides an overview of Istio, now let’s focus on the goal of this article.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;preparing-the-kubernetes-cluster&quot;&gt;Preparing the Kubernetes cluster&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let us prepare a Kubernetes cluster to deploy Istio and our application containers. Follow the instructions for any one of the platforms you prefer.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;prerequisites&quot;&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We will be using &lt;a href=&quot;https://helm.sh/&quot;&gt;Helm&lt;/a&gt; to install Istio on the Kubernetes cluster and &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/&quot;&gt;kubectl&lt;/a&gt; for deploying the applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/helm/helm&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Helm&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The Kubernetes package manager. &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/helm/helm#install&quot;&gt;Install&lt;/a&gt; it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/kubectl/kubectl/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kubectl&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The command-line tool to interact with Kubernetes. &lt;a href=&quot;https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-kubectl/&quot;&gt;Install&lt;/a&gt; and configure it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-cluster-on-azure-kubernetes-serviceaks&quot;&gt;Create a cluster on Azure Kubernetes Service(AKS)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to use Azure, then install &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Azure CLI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to interact with Azure. Install and login with your Azure account (you can create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/&quot;&gt;free account&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have one already). If not skip this section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, let us create a resource group. You can use any region you like here instead of East-US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;az group create &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; eCommerceCluster &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--location&lt;/span&gt; eastus
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Create the Kubernetes cluster:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
5
6
7
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;az aks create &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--resource-group&lt;/span&gt; eCommerceCluster &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; eCommerceCluster &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--node-count&lt;/span&gt; 4 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--kubernetes-version&lt;/span&gt; 1.13.7 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--enable-addons&lt;/span&gt; monitoring &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--generate-ssh-keys&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;node-count&lt;/code&gt; flag is important as the setup requires at least four nodes with the default CPU to run everything. You can try to use a higher &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubernetes-version&lt;/code&gt; if it is supported, else stick to 1.13&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cluster creation could take while so sit back and relax. 🍹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the cluster is created, fetch its credentials to be used from kubectl by running the below command. It automatically injects the credentials to your kubectl configuration under &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;az aks get-credentials &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--resource-group&lt;/span&gt; eCommerceCluster &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; eCommerceCluster
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the created cluster in the Azure portal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/3284/1*yfLnHHc_N7VCkEY9vjNciQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kubernetes cluster in AKS&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kubernetes cluster in AKS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubectl get nodes&lt;/code&gt; to see it in the command line and to verify that kubectl can connect to your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*k8xsRqQsvnquUhGPAh9TsA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cluster Nodes&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cluster Nodes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Proceed to the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#install-and-setup-istio&quot;&gt;Install and setup Istio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; section.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;create-a-cluster-on-google-kubernetes-enginegke&quot;&gt;Create a cluster on Google Kubernetes Engine(GKE)&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are going to use Google Cloud Platform(GCP) then install &lt;a href=&quot;https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gcloud CLI&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to interact with GCP. Install and login with your GCP account (you can create a &lt;a href=&quot;https://console.cloud.google.com/freetrial&quot;&gt;free account&lt;/a&gt; if you don’t have one already).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can set a region and zone using below commands or you can pass the zone option while executing each command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;gcloud config &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;compute/region europe-west1
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;gcloud config &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;compute/zone europe-west1-b
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, we need a GCP project, you can either use an existing project that you have or create a new one using GCloud CLI with below command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;gcloud projects create jhipster-demo-deepu
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set the project you want to use as the default project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;gcloud config &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;set &lt;/span&gt;project jhipster-demo-deepu
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us create a cluster for our application with the below command:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;gcloud container clusters create hello-hipster &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--cluster-version&lt;/span&gt; 1.13 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--num-nodes&lt;/span&gt; 4 &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--machine-type&lt;/span&gt; n1-standard-2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;num-nodes&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;machine-type&lt;/code&gt; flags are important as the setup requires at least four nodes with a bigger CPU to run everything. You can try to use a higher &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;cluster-version&lt;/code&gt; if it is supported, else stick to 1.13.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The cluster creation could take while so sit back and relax. 🍹&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the cluster is created, fetch its credentials to be used from kubectl by running the below command. It automatically injects the credentials to your kubectl configuration under &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;~/.kube/config&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;gcloud container clusters get-credentials hello-hipster
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can view the created cluster in the GCP GUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*ZxNbIG4vqWJymTLweJpPyQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kubernetes cluster on GKE&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kubernetes cluster on GKE&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubectl get nodes&lt;/code&gt; to see it in the command line and to verify that kubectl can connect to your cluster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2000/1*F5Qcd_GS_GSuA1PsJE7gvA.png&quot; alt=&quot;Cluster Nodes&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cluster Nodes&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;install-and-setup-istio&quot;&gt;Install and setup Istio&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Install Istio on your local machine by following these steps:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;ISTIO_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;1.3.0

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;curl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-L&lt;/span&gt; https://git.io/getLatestIstio | sh -

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;ln&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-sf&lt;/span&gt; istio-&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ISTIO_VERSION&lt;/span&gt; istio

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;PATH&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;~/istio/bin:&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$PATH&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, create a role binding on the Kubernetes cluster for Istio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--clusterrole&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;cluster-admin &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--user&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;gcloud config get-value core/account&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us create a namespace for Istio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;kubectl create namespace istio-system
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us install Istio on our Kubernetes cluster using the provided helm charts from Istio.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; ~/istio-&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ISTIO_VERSION&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Install the Istio CRDs&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;helm template &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;/kubernetes/helm/istio-init &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; istio-init &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--namespace&lt;/span&gt; istio-system | kubectl apply &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; -

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Run this to verify all CRDs are installed. It should output 23 for this version of Istio.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;kubectl get crds | &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;grep&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'istio.io\|certmanager.k8s.io'&lt;/span&gt; | &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;wc&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# Install the Istio demo set up so that we get Grafana, Jaeger &amp;amp; Kiali set up as well.&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c&quot;&gt;# For production, use the Istio default setup. Refer https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/install/helm/&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;helm template &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;/kubernetes/helm/istio &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--name&lt;/span&gt; istio &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--namespace&lt;/span&gt; istio-system &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;--values&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;install&lt;/span&gt;/kubernetes/helm/istio/values-istio-demo.yaml | kubectl apply &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-f&lt;/span&gt; -
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wait for the pods to run, these will be deployed to the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;istio-system&lt;/code&gt; namespace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;watch kubectl get pods &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; istio-system
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the pods are in running status, exit the watch loop and run the below to get the Ingress gateway service details. This is the only service that is exposed to an external IP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
3
4
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;kubectl get svc istio-ingressgateway &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; istio-system

NAME                   TYPE           CLUSTER-IP     EXTERNAL-IP
istio-ingressgateway   LoadBalancer   10.27.249.83   35.195.81.130
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;istio-ingressgateway&lt;/code&gt; shows external IP as &lt;pending&gt;, wait a few minutes until an IP address has been assigned.&lt;/pending&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The external IP is very important here, let us save this to an environment variable so that we can use it in further commands.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;INGRESS_IP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;kubectl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; istio-system get svc &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  istio-ingressgateway &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;jsonpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now our Kubernetes cluster is ready for Istio. 🎉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;For advanced Istio setup options refer to &lt;a href=&quot;https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/&quot;&gt;https://istio.io/docs/setup/kubernetes/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;creating-the-microservice-application-stack&quot;&gt;Creating the microservice application stack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of my &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/create-full-microservice-stack-using-jhipster-domain-language-under-30-minutes-4ele&quot;&gt;previous posts&lt;/a&gt;, I showcased how to create a full-stack microservice architecture using &lt;strong&gt;JHipster&lt;/strong&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;JDL&lt;/strong&gt;. You can read the post &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/create-full-microservice-stack-using-jhipster-domain-language-under-30-minutes-4ele&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; if you want to learn more details about it. For this exercise, we will use the same application but we will not use the Eureka service discovery option we used earlier. Also, note that the store application is further split into Gateway and Product applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;architecture&quot;&gt;Architecture&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the architecture of the microservice that we are going to create and deploy today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2162/1*UmNJ-Ue362-OltPOxt-OFQ.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microservice architecture with Istio&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microservice architecture with Istio&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It has a gateway application and three microservice applications. Each of them has its own database. You can see that each application has an Envoy proxy attached to the pod as a sidecar. Istio control plane components are also deployed to the same cluster along with Prometheus, Grafana, and Jaeger.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Ingress gateway from Istio is the only entry point for traffic and it routes traffic to all microservices accordingly. Telemetry is collected from all the containers running in the cluster, including the applications, databases, and Istio components.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared to the architecture of the original application &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/create-full-microservice-stack-using-jhipster-domain-language-under-30-minutes-4ele&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, you can clearly see that we replaced the JHipster registry and Netflix OSS components with Istio. The ELK monitoring stack is replaced with Prometheus, Grafana and Jaeger configured by Istio. Here is the original architecture diagram without Istio for a quick visual comparison.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2162/1*H-6_dz1-aYXQ-fzWEuJcRw.png&quot; alt=&quot;Microservice architecture with Netflix OSS&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Microservice architecture with Netflix OSS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-jdl&quot;&gt;Application JDL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s take a look at the modified JDL declaration. You can see that we have declared &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;serviceDiscoveryType no&lt;/code&gt; here since we will be using Istio for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;noscript&gt;&lt;pre&gt;400: Invalid request
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/noscript&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;https://gist.github.com/8e568eb7b5b5e3c00af0fdf3d2cf71ba.js&quot;&gt; &lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;deployment-jdl&quot;&gt;Deployment JDL&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JHipster version 5.7.0 introduced support for deployment declaration straight in the JDL&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;jekyll-twitter-plugin&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote class=&quot;twitter-tweet&quot;&gt;&lt;p lang=&quot;en&quot; dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Towards the future of &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/JHipster?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#JHipster&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ScaffoldingAsCode?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;#ScaffoldingAsCode&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Check this out. Soon you will be able to define apps, entities and deployment options with a single JDL file and generate everything with a single command. Hopefully, we can demo this for &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/Devoxx?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;@Devoxx&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;https://t.co/u28cwaymfc&quot;&gt;https://t.co/u28cwaymfc&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Deepu K Sasidharan ( ദീപു, தீபு, दीपू ) (@deepu105) &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/deepu105/status/1056588722769195018?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&quot;&gt;October 28, 2018&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have the below in our JDL which declares our Kubernetes deployment:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-groovy highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;deploymentType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kubernetes&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;appsFolders&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;store&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;invoice&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;notification&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;product&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;dockerRepositoryName&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;deepu105&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;serviceDiscoveryType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;no&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;istio&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;kc&quot;&gt;true&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kubernetesServiceType&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;Ingress&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;kubernetesNamespace&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;jhipster&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;ingressDomain&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;35.195.81.130.nip.io&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;serviceDiscoveryType&lt;/code&gt; is disabled and we have enabled &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Istio&lt;/code&gt; support — the Envoy sidecars are injected automatically for the selected applications. Istio routes are also generated for the applications automatically.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubernetesServiceType&lt;/code&gt; is set as &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;Ingress&lt;/code&gt;, which is very important as Istio can only work with an Ingress controller service type. For Ingress, we need to set the domain DNS and this is where the Istio ingress gateway IP is needed. Now we need a DNS for our IP. For real use-cases, you should map a DNS for the IP, but for testing and demo purposes we can use a wildcard DNS service like &lt;a href=&quot;http://nip.io&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;nip.io&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to resolve our IP. Just append nip.io to our IP and use that as the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;ingressDomain&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; I was switching between multiple clusters while writing this article as I didn’t want to keep them running and hence my istio-ingressgateway IP might be different between samples and screenshots. Use the IP based on your own setup if you are running these samples.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;generate-the-applications-and-deployment-manifests&quot;&gt;Generate the applications and deployment manifests&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that our JDL is ready, let us scaffold our applications and Kubernetes manifests. Create a new directory and save the above JDL in the directory. Let us name it &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;app-istio.jdl&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; and then run the import-jdl command.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;mkdir &lt;/span&gt;istio-demo &lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;istio-demo
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;jhipster import-jdl app-istio.jdl
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This will generate all the applications and install the required NPM dependencies in each of them. Once the applications are generated the deployment manifests will be generated and some useful instruction will be printed to the console.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2776/0*ROg2XrRkHVHA4Xib&quot; alt=&quot;Generation output&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Generation output&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open the generated code in your favorite IDE/Editor and explore the code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;interim-issues-with-generated-code&quot;&gt;Interim issues with generated code&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/10135&quot;&gt;bug&lt;/a&gt; in the latest JHipster version which creates some incorrect URLs for Istio, it has been fixed as of JHipster version 6.3.0 &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/pull/10138&quot;&gt;here is the PR&lt;/a&gt; for the issue.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deploy-to-kubernetes-cluster-using-kubectl&quot;&gt;Deploy to Kubernetes cluster using Kubectl&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now let us build and deploy our applications. Run the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;./gradlew bootJar -Pprod jibDockerBuild&lt;/code&gt; command in the store, product, invoice, and notification folders to build the docker images. Once the images are built, push them to your docker repo with these commands. Note to change the Docker hub id from &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;deepu105&lt;/code&gt; to your id.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker image tag store deepu105/store
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker push deepu105/store

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker image tag invoice deepu105/invoice
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker push deepu105/invoice

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker image tag notification deepu105/notification
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker push deepu105/notification

&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker image tag product deepu105/product
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;docker push deepu105/product
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once the images are pushed, navigate into the generated Kubernetes directory and run the provided startup script. (If you are on windows you can run the steps in &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;kubectl-apply.sh&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; manually one by one.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1
2
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;cd &lt;/span&gt;kubernetes
&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;./kubectl-apply.sh
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;watch kubectl get pods -n jhipster&lt;/code&gt; to monitor the status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;deployed-applications&quot;&gt;Deployed applications&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once all the pods are in running status we can explore the deployed applications&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;application-gateway&quot;&gt;Application gateway&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The store gateway application is the entry point for our microservices. Get the URL for the store app by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo store.jhipster.$INGRESS_IP.nip.io&lt;/code&gt;, we already stored the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;INGRESS_IP&lt;/code&gt; to environment variables while creating the Istio setup. The URLs are also printed on console by the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;kubectl-apply.sh&lt;/code&gt; script. Visit the URL in your favorite browser and explore the application. Try creating some entities for the microservices:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/cyd7foljtf7qkm6amgjj.png&quot; alt=&quot;Store gateway application&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Store gateway application&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;monitoring&quot;&gt;Monitoring&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Istio setup includes Grafana and Prometheus configured to collect and show metrics from our containers. Let’s take a look.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us look at Grafana by visiting the provided URL. Get it by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo grafana.istio-system.$INGRESS_IP.nip.io&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/x7ck1zidvch5m75tqimp.png&quot; alt=&quot;Grafana dashboard for the Store application&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grafana dashboard for the Store application&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Grafana uses the metrics scraped by Prometheus. By default, only Grafana is exposed to external IP and hence we will use kubectl port forwarding to set up a secure tunnel to Prometheus available on &lt;a href=&quot;localhost:9090&quot;&gt;localhost:9090&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;language-bash highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;table class=&quot;rouge-table&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-gutter gl&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;lineno&quot;&gt;1

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class=&quot;rouge-code&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;$ &lt;/span&gt;kubectl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; istio-system &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    port-forward &lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;$(&lt;/span&gt;kubectl &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-n&lt;/span&gt; istio-system get pod &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-l&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;se&quot;&gt;\&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;app&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;prometheus &lt;span class=&quot;nt&quot;&gt;-o&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nv&quot;&gt;jsonpath&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;o&quot;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'{.items[0].metadata.name}'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; 9090:9090
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/2554/0*W4obHNne_wQJfAuU&quot; alt=&quot;Prometheus dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Prometheus dashboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;observability&quot;&gt;Observability&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Istio configures Jaeger for distributed tracing and Kiali for service observability. Let us take a look at them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Get the Jaeger URL by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo jaeger.istio-system.$INGRESS_IP.nip.io&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/jifcfkspq5ojpein913w.png&quot; alt=&quot;Jaeger tracing dashboard&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jaeger tracing dashboard&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can make some requests in the application and find it in the tracing dashboard by querying for the service. Click on any request to see tracing details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let us now look at Kiali. Get the URL by running &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;echo kiali.istio-system.$INGRESS_IP.nip.io&lt;/code&gt;, use the credentials user: &lt;em&gt;admin&lt;/em&gt;, password: &lt;em&gt;admin&lt;/em&gt; to log in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/w9r30s3q4rmctjzejdwp.png&quot; alt=&quot;Kiali service graph&quot; /&gt;&lt;em&gt;Kiali service graph&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Istio provides building blocks to build distributed microservices in a more Kubernetes-native way and takes the complexity and responsibility of maintaining those blocks away from you. This means you do not have to worry about maintaining the code or deployments for service discovery, tracing and so on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Istio documentation says&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Deploying a microservice-based application in an Istio service mesh allows one to externally control service monitoring and tracing, request (version) routing, resiliency testing, security and policy enforcement, etc., in a consistent way across the services, for the application as a whole.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Werner Vogels (CTO of AWS) quoted at AWS Re:Invent&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;“In the future, all the code you ever write will be business logic.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Istio Service mesh helps to make that reality closer. This lets you worry only about the applications that you are developing and with JHipster that future is truly here and you just need to worry about writing your business logic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this is great, it is not a silver bullet. Keep in mind that Istio is fairly new compared to other stable and battle-tested solutions like JHipster Registry (Eureka) or Consul and overall such architectures are suitable only for complex distributed applications.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, another thing to keep in mind is the resource requirements. The same microservices with JHipster Registry or Consul can be deployed to a 2 node cluster with 1 vCPU and 3.75 GB of memory per node in GCP while you need a 4 node cluster with 2 vCPUs and 7.5 GB of memory per node for Istio enabled deployments. The demo profile from Istio, we used, doesn’t apply any request limits for resources, and by adding and tuning those, the minimum requirement could be reduced. But still, I don’t think you can get it as low as that is needed for the JHipster registry option.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a real-world use case, the advantages of not having to maintain the complex parts of your infra vs having to pay for more resources might be a decision that has to be taken based on your priorities and goals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A huge shout out to &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/saturnism&quot;&gt;Ray Tsang&lt;/a&gt; for helping me figure out an optimal cluster size for this application originally. Also a huge thank you from myself and the community to both Ray and &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/humourmind&quot;&gt;Srinivasa Vasu&lt;/a&gt; for adding the Istio support to JHipster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;JHipster provides a great Kubernetes setup to start with which you can further tweak as per your needs and platform. The Istio support will &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster/issues/7708&quot;&gt;improve&lt;/a&gt; further over time, but it’s still a great starting point especially to learn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To learn more about JHipster and Full stack development, check out my book “&lt;em&gt;Full Stack Development with JHipster&lt;/em&gt;” on &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Stack-Development-JHipster-Deepu-Sasidharan/dp/178847631X&quot;&gt;Amazon&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.packtpub.com/application-development/full-stack-development-jhipster&quot;&gt;Packt&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a great Istio tutorial from Ray Tsang &lt;a href=&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Qo8o5C4UpGwMF7Mg02kLTaU4-xCSfJjLcnIFNveMEEA&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I did a talk at &lt;a href=&quot;https://dvbe18.confinabox.com/talk/XCM-6395/JHipster_5_-_What's_new_and_noteworthy&quot;&gt;Devoxx 2018&lt;/a&gt; along with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.julien-dubois.com/&quot;&gt;Julien Dubois&lt;/a&gt; doing the same demo and promised that I’d write a detailed blog about it. This blog was originally based on that.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>My VS Code setup - Making the most out of VS Code</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Please follow me on &lt;a href=&quot;https://twitter.com/deepu105&quot;&gt;Twitter&lt;/a&gt; for updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://code.visualstudio.com/&quot;&gt;Visual Studio Code&lt;/a&gt;(I like the sound of VS Code better), I just love it. It is my primary IDE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I always loved lightweight editors over IDEs. Many years ago I was using Eclipse for development and &lt;a href=&quot;https://notepad-plus-plus.org/&quot;&gt;Notepad++&lt;/a&gt; with some plugins for all other lightweight stuff. Then I discovered sublime text and was using it for a while. I still was finding Eclipse too heavyweight when I was doing web development. Then came &lt;a href=&quot;http://brackets.io/&quot;&gt;Brackets&lt;/a&gt; from Adobe. It was a fairly nice editor especially for web development and I started using it heavily for web development. But Brackets was bit slow back then on a large codebase. Then came &lt;a href=&quot;https://atom.io/&quot;&gt;Atom&lt;/a&gt; which revolutionized the NodeJS desktop application landscape by introducing the Atom shell which ultimately became &lt;a href=&quot;https://electronjs.org/&quot;&gt;Electron&lt;/a&gt;. So I switched to Atom and loved its slick interface and nice pluggable features. It became my primary editor for all web development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So Electron paved the way for VS Code and though at first, I was skeptical due to the association with Visual Studio, I tried it out and was amazed by its speed and user experience. There was no turning back now. I slowly started using VS Code for most of my day to day development, except for Java which I was using IntelliJ by now. Fast forward now below are the editor/IDE I use for development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VS Code&lt;/strong&gt;: JavaScript, TypeScript, EJS, HTML, CSS, Golang, Python, Ruby, Shell, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform and everything in between including writing this blog post.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;IntelliJ Idea&lt;/strong&gt;: Java, Scala, Kotlin (Though I use VS Code for minor edits and to read the code, etc)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;VIM&lt;/strong&gt;: For quick edits from the command line.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;plugins&quot;&gt;Plugins&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Of course VS Code makes all this possible by allowing the use of plugins and there is a lot to choose from. Here are the plugins that I personally use to work on the above-said languages. You can use the &lt;code class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;code --install-extension&lt;/code&gt; command to install them from the terminal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;language-support&quot;&gt;Language support&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the Languages you work with you can add syntax, utility and language support plugins for those. I use the below&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;javascripttypescriptweb&quot;&gt;JavaScript/TypeScript/Web&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;

    &lt;/blockquote&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;jvm&quot;&gt;JVM&lt;/h3&gt;

  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Java support indeed is getting better and better, so I hope one day I can completely switch to VS Code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;conclusion&quot;&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This might seem like too many plugins but on &lt;a href=&quot;https://dev.to/deepu105/my-beautiful-linux-development-environment-2afc&quot;&gt;my configuration&lt;/a&gt; VS Code is lightning fast and loads up immediately and is faster then IntelliJ to load and work with. The beauty of VS Code is that you don’t need all the plugin all the time, you can disable the ones not required per workspace to make it even faster.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many people &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/c42kpk/my_beautiful_linux_development_environment/erum9sf/&quot;&gt;ask&lt;/a&gt; me why I use VS Code when I have IntelliJ and my answer have been always the same. IntelliJ is great but its also quite heavy. While all those advanced features are needed for Java, Scala or Kotlin development, VS Code is perfectly capable of giving a nice developer experience for lightweight languages like JS, TS, Go, Python, Rust, Ruby, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a regular user of both IntelliJ and VS Code, I prefer VS Code as much as possible. The user experience is much nicer for my taste. In fact, I like the developer experience in VS Code better for JavaScript, TypeScript, Web, Python, and Golang. Also switching between them for JVM projects and others don’t feel weird for me as I have the same keyboard mappings for both. The only time I fire up IntelliJ these days is when I want to do full-fledged Java development. For everything else, I use VS Code.&lt;/p&gt;
