You'll start by understanding JHipster and its associated tools, along with the essentials of full stack development, before building a monolithic web application. You'll then learn the JHipster Domain Language (JDL) with entity modeling using JDL Studio. With this book, you'll create production-ready web applications using Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Angular, and Bootstrap, and run tests and set up Continuous Integration pipelines with Jenkins. As you advance, you'll learn how to convert your monoliths to microservices and how to package your application for production with various deployment options, including Heroku and Google Cloud. You'll also learn about Docker and Kubernetes, along with an introduction to the Istio service mesh. Finally, you'll build your client-side with React and Vue.js and discover JHipster's best practices.

By the end of the book, you'll be able to leverage the best tools available to build modern web applications.

From here you will learn the JHipster Domain Language with entity modeling and entity creation using JDL and JDL studio. Moving on, you will be introduced to client side technologies such as Angular and Bootstrap and will delve into technologies such as Spring Security, Spring MVC, and Spring Data. You will learn to build and package applications for production with various deployment options such as Heroku and more. During the course of the book, you will be introduced to microservice server-side technologies and how to break your monolithic application into microservices. Next, the book takes you through cloud deployment of microservices on Docker and Kubernetes. Going forward, you will learn to build your client side with React and master JHipster best practices.

By the end of the book, you will be able to leverage the power of the best tools available to build modern web applications.
