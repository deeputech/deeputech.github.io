I built my first PC when I was in high school, in 2003. It was an Intel Pentium 4 system, not high specs or anything, just whatever I could afford at that time. I loved that PC like a child and it served me quite well for next few years. I used it for Photoshop, 3DS max, some light gaming and so on. But most importantly building that PC got me hooked to PC building and gave me an opportunity to pursue that as a part time business where I was building custom PCs for friends and others through word of mouth marketing. I was in college by then and this served as a channel of income for me. I probably built anywhere from 70 to 80 PC in the course of 4 years. I stopped building PCs when I started my IT career and moved onto using Windows Laptops and later to Linux Laptops

Flash forward to 2020 and PC landscape has changed quite a lot. I recently purchased an Oculus Quest VR headset and got hooked to VR gaming so as a natural progression I wanted to play the best VR game out there, yes Half Life Alyx. But this meant I needed a Windows Gaming PC which I don't have since my primary workstation is a Dell Precision running Fedora, you can read about that setup [here](https://dev.to/deepu105/my-beautiful-linux-development-environment-2afc), and my work laptop is a MacBook. So I decided to awake the PC nerd in me and build myself a gaming PC üòÅ

Initially I thought of building a budget machine for under 600‚Ç¨ since I was pretty sure I probably won't use that machine for anything other than VR gaming but as usual the PC nerd in me won and I ended up building a pretty good machine for around 1000‚Ç¨

## Configuration

So without further adieu, lets jump into the configuration

Here are the parts

I already had an NVME SSD and a 2.5" SATA drive so decided to use those those, its just 1TB now, but I'm planning to add a 2 or 4 TB SATA HDD later based on storage needs. I already have a 34" widescreen monitor as well. I also bought a windows 10 pro licence and some rechargeable batteries for the Oculus controllers. The entire setup cost me around 1500‚Ç¨ and that is not including software and game licence costs

## Build

After almost a week of waiting for the components to arrive, I finally started the most exciting part of the process.

### CPU & Motherboard

I always liked AMD processors when I was building PCs back in the days, but then AMD started loosing out to Intel and I was sad to see that. Now AMD is back in the game and clearly is the best choice when it comes to CPUs. The Ryzen series is just amazing, I would have never dreamed of the 64 core [Threadripper](https://www.amd.com/en/products/ryzen-threadripper) processors, let alone the 16 core Ryzen 9s. I decided to stick to the Budget friendly Ryzen 5 series as they were powerful and provided best value for money. Intel couldn't even compete in that category IMO. I choose the 6 core **Ryzen 5 3600** as it fit my needs perfectly. Origianlly I was planning to use the stock cooler, but after the build I found the CPU temperature quite high on high load and the stock cooler fan was too loud so I changed it with an **Arctic Freezer 34** tower cooler.

I choose **ASRock B450M Steel Legend** as the motherboard as it was the best value for money option. It had excellent quality, lot of ports, great reviews and great price. I considered getting an x570 chipset but then didn't see enough value in spending 100‚Ç¨ more on that

I choose to start with a dual channel 16GB RAM from Corsair. I might add another 16GB later if needed. Since my work room doesn't have a LAN connection, I also bought a PCIe WiFi card from TP-Link which came with integrated bluetooth 4.

### Graphics card

The GPU is undoubtedly the most important part of a gaming machine and hence I decided to settle for one of the best GPU from AMD. I did consider some Nvidia cards but again the AMD RX 5700 XT was more value for money and can handle demanding games and VR perfectly fine for next few years. Didn't make sense to pay 50% more for a 10% performance increase from Nvidia.

I specifically got the **Gigabyte Radeon RX 5700 XT GAMING OC 8GB** as it had the best reviews and great thermal efficiency. It is huge though compared to NVidia cards in same category

### Case & PSU

For the PC case I initially choose a Cooler Master Q300L but then found out it had some cooling issues and hence bought a **Fractal Design Meshify C Mini**. It looks beautiful and I love the quality. It has good thermal efficiency, ample space and great cable management. It also came with 2 fans.

To power the RX 5700XT and Ryzen CPU, I choose to go with a 750W power supply from Cooler Master. Its 150 more than the recommended 600W but I guess this gives me some space for expansion later on. I also bought 3 additional fans so that I can have 3 intake fans and two exhaust fans creating a positive pressure inside the case, which is good for cooling and avoids dust build up. I'm not too much into RGB but was curious so bought one RGB fan for the front intake and I quite liked the end result.

### VR Headset

So originally I bought the Oculus Quest 64GB, the 128GB is not worth the premium as the only advantage it offers in the memory bump which is not that important IMO, as I wanted a standalone headset without having to build a PC. I didn't even look into possibility of using it for PC VR. Then when I started considering PC VR, luckily Oculus also announced the Link support for Quest which lets you use a USB-C cable to connect it to a PC. It was great news and since then the Link support is getting better and better. IMO Quest is a great choice at this price point as you can use it for PC VR and also for standalone games on the go. Of course, it might not be having the display quality of Vive Index but it has very descent quality.

I tried to play PC VR using the included USB-C 2.0 cable and it was ok but I bought a 5 meter USB-C 3.0 cable for better bandwidth and it works quite well

## Performance

Now that I have finished the build its time for some benchmarks. I'm gonna use the standard benchmarking tools like Cinebench, PCMark and so on.
