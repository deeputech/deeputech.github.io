[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)(I like the sound of VS Code better), I just love it. It is my primary code editor. 

I always loved lightweight editors over IDEs. Many years ago I was using Eclipse for development and [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/) with some plugins for all other lightweight stuff. Then I discovered sublime text and was using it for a while. I still was finding Eclipse too heavyweight when I was doing web development. Then came [Brackets](http://brackets.io/) from Adobe. It was a fairly nice editor especially for web development and I started using it heavily for web development. But Brackets was bit slow back then on a large codebase. Then came [Atom](https://atom.io/) which revolutionized the NodeJS desktop application landscape by introducing the Atom shell which ultimately became [Electron](https://electronjs.org/). So I switched to Atom and loved its slick interface and nice pluggable features. It became my primary editor for all web development. 

So Electron paved the way for VS Code and though at first, I was skeptical due to the association with Visual Studio, I tried it out and was amazed by its speed and user experience. There was no turning back now. I slowly started using VS Code for most of my day to day development, except for JVM development which I was using IntelliJ Ultimate by now and it is hard to beat IntelliJ for JVM development. Fast forward now below are the editor/IDE I use for development.

- **VS Code**: JavaScript, TypeScript, EJS, HTML, CSS, Golang, Rust, Python, Ruby, Shell, Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform and everything in between including writing this blog post.
- **IntelliJ Idea**: Java, Scala, Kotlin, Groovy
- **VIM**: For quick edits from the command line.

# Plugins

Of course VS Code makes all this possible by allowing the use of plugins and there is a lot to choose from. Here are the plugins that I personally use to work on the above-said languages. You can use the `code --install-extension` command to install them from the terminal.

## Language support

Based on the Languages you work with you can add syntax, utility and language support plugins for those. I use the below

### JavaScript/TypeScript/Web

- [EJS language support](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DigitalBrainstem.javascript-ejs-support) - Adds [EJS](https://ejs.co/) template support.
  > `code --install-extension DigitalBrainstem.javascript-ejs-support`

  > `code --install-extension Compulim.compulim-vscode-closetag`
- [ESLint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=dbaeumer.vscode-eslint) - Adds support for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) rules.
  > `code --install-extension dbaeumer.vscode-eslint`

# Terminal setup

If you are using Zsh shell with Oh-my-zsh like me as explained [here](https://dev.to/deepu105/configure-a-beautiful-terminal-on-unix-with-zsh-4mcb), you might want to do the below to get the same terminal experience in the integrated VSCode terminal as well.

![](https://thepracticaldev.s3.amazonaws.com/i/ae6wi9anly8clq12z9na.png)

Follow these steps
- Download and install a [patched font](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts/blob/master/patched-fonts/SourceCodePro/Medium/complete/Sauce%20Code%20Pro%20Medium%20Nerd%20Font%20Complete%20Mono.ttf).
- On Linux, run `fc-cache -f -v` to refresh font cache.
- On VSCode, open Preferences → Settings and click on the `{}` icon to open JSON mode and set the below
```json
    "terminal.integrated.shell.linux": "/usr/bin/zsh",
    "terminal.integrated.fontFamily": "'SauceCodePro Nerd Font Mono','Source Code Pro'",
    "terminal.integrated.rightClickCopyPaste": true,
    "terminal.integrated.fontSize": 14,
    "terminal.integrated.cursorStyle": "underline",
    "terminal.integrated.cursorBlinking": true
```
Replace `linux` with `osx` if you are on a Mac.

# Conclusion

This might seem like too many plugins but on [my configuration](https://dev.to/deepu105/my-beautiful-linux-development-environment-2afc) VS Code is lightning fast and loads up immediately and is faster then IntelliJ to load and work with. The beauty of VS Code is that you don't need all the plugin all the time, you can disable the ones not required per workspace to make it even faster.

Many people [ask](https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/c42kpk/my_beautiful_linux_development_environment/erum9sf/) me why I use VS Code when I have IntelliJ and my answer have been always the same. IntelliJ is great but its also quite heavy. While all those advanced features are needed for Java, Scala or Kotlin development, VS Code is perfectly capable of giving a nice developer experience for lightweight languages like JS, TS, Go, Python, Rust, Ruby, etc. 

As a regular user of both IntelliJ and VS Code, I prefer VS Code as much as possible. The user experience is much nicer for my taste. In fact, I like the developer experience in VS Code better for JavaScript, TypeScript, Web, Python, and Golang. Also switching between them for JVM projects and others don't feel weird for me as I have the same keyboard mappings for both. The only time I fire up IntelliJ these days is when I want to do full-fledged Java development. For everything else, I use VS Code.
